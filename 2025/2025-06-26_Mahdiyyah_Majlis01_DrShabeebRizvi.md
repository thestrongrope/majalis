### The Glory of Hurr: A Marsiya by Mir Anis

This is a Marsiya (elegy) by Mir Anis in honor of Hurr's glory, of which some stanzas are being recited.

When Hurr, the chosen one, came from the side of the king in the battlefield, with what joy he came, flying his horse. The sympathizer of the oppressed Syed (master) came like a blooming flower. The self-sacrificing son of the lion of God, the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), came. A veil of light is visible on the path, the splendor of God's power is visible. The sun is a mere particle where his bright shadow falls, a moon that even the beautiful ones would swear by. What a shield of the arm of David, that even the senses of the fairies are stunned by such a steed. In the garden of the world, the fragrance of spring has come, the flower is in his hand, the ride of Solomon has come.

And he called out, "You speak the truth, indeed, undoubtedly, my faults are hidden in the hem of the garment of Hazrat Shabbir (Imam Hussain). My wealth is not that my lap is empty, nor my pocket. The unseen voice gives the call of 'Barakallah' (May God bless you). Having received grace, I have come for swordsmanship. I went from here as a needy person and came from there as a wealthy one."

Hearing these words, the evil-hearted one called out, "Yes, let the spears and arrows fly at the supporter of the king of guidance." The crowd of the army advanced with their weapons to capture him. The young man, having recited the Fatiha (opening chapter of the Quran), drew his sword. Hurr's face turned red, the army of oppression turned pale. From the flame of the sword, the flash of lightning became dust. The roars of the lion-like warrior echoed, the foundations of the earth trembled like Rustam's. The ranks of the army were turned upside down, the firm ones were shaken. The sharp sword flashed, and even fate trembled with fear. The time for battle had not yet come, but hearts were broken. Banners fell, and standards were dropped from hands.

The Day of Judgment had broken out when the sword of the dignified Hurr moved. The lightning went towards the battlefield to rain fire. With what a charm that Layla of victory, the fire, moved. Sometimes it stopped, sometimes it advanced, sometimes it paused, sometimes it moved. The wounds on the chests of the poor were bursting open like flowers. What a gait it was that the throats of thousands were cut. It was not stopped by stones, nor by iron. It snatched away hands from the wrists and heads from the necks. Its severe blow could not be withstood by any armor. It passed through the enemy ranks wherever it came from. Showing the storm's fury, that beautiful one went. Every boat of the body sank in the river of blood.

Abbas advanced and said, "Bravo, what courage and honor!" The beloved of the king was calling out "Barakallah" (May God bless you). The son of Hasan was saying, "Wow, Ghazi (warrior), wow!" The king was saying "Masha'Allah" (God has willed it) at every strike. When the Ghazi received the reward for his bravery, he would smile and bow in submission. Alas, when the accursed ones found an opportunity in his bowing, they left the front and the whole army came from behind. Hundreds of thousands on that side and he alone on this side. He turned his horse, but a spear struck him. He fell into the clutches of death, it did not take long. A mace struck his shoulder, a sword struck him. His chest was pierced, arrows were shot by the enemies. The lion-like warrior placed his head on the ground. Ali Akbar said to the Hazrat (Imam Hussain), crying out, "The king has fallen, so I will go and take care of the guest." The journey from the house of life to non-existence is happening. Now the brave Hurr is falling from his horse onto the dust.

Hazrat Abbas submitted, "The servant is going." The king said in a state of emotion, "No, O beloved son. He was killed in my love, a good end for a good man. What kind of friends are we if we do not come to help in a difficult time? When a difficult time comes upon him, we will be of use. What of the corpse, will we go to the grave of the guest?"

Saying these words, the master of the two worlds, Shabbir (Imam Hussain), went to the battlefield. There, the dignified Hurr fell from his horse onto the dust. Seeing the king coming, the cowardly ones fled. The Imam of the two worlds reached the corpse at the last moment. He saw the garden of the guest's existence being destroyed. He saw the wounded one rubbing his heels on the dust.

Falling next to the corpse, the master cried out, "O my helper, my supporter, my aide! What mace struck you that my back is broken? You fell from the horse and I did not even know. What friend finds peace in the separation of a friend? Open your eyes, brother, Hussain has come."

With half-open eyes, he saw the face of his master. He saw the pillow of Shabbir's knee under his head. Smiling, he looked towards the heavens. The king said, "O Hurr, O brave Hurr, what did you see?" He submitted, "I see the face of a houri (maiden of paradise). I see light from the throne to the earth."

"O Qibla (direction of prayer), O Qibla of religion, take care of my corpse. Recite Surah Yasin, for this is the last breath. The journey is ahead, O king of the throne of the heavens. My dear soul is leaving my body. Now I cannot even speak. Please give me something to cover myself, O master, I am feeling sleepy."

Saying this, he took a stretch in Shabbir's lap. Sweat appeared on his forehead, his face turned pale. The king said, "Why did you leave us, brother?" The brave Hurr passed away, and no sound came again. The bird of the soul flew towards the Tuba tree (tree in paradise). The pupils of his eyes remained fixed on the face of the king of the worlds. The pupils of his eyes remained fixed on the face of the king of the worlds.

### The Foundation of Ma'rifat: Imam Hussain's Wisdom

The lecture begins with a supplication and a pivotal Hadith from Imam Hussain (peace be upon him):

اللَّهِ السَّمِيعِ الْعَلِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ
I seek refuge in Allah, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, from the accursed Satan.

بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ الْعَلِيِّ الْعَظِيمِ
There is no power and no strength except with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great.

حَسْبُنَا اللَّهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ نِعْمَ الْمَوْلَى وَنِعْمَ النَّصِيرُ
Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs, the best Master and the best Helper.

الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.

The prayer and peace be upon the noblest of the prophets and messengers, the beloved of the God of the worlds, Abu al-Qasim Muhammad, may Allah bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, peace be upon him and his pure, immaculate, and infallible family, from whom Allah has removed all impurity and purified them with a thorough purification. O Allah, send blessings upon our master and our lady, Fatimah al-Zahra, the piece of the Messenger and the coolness of the eye of the virgin.
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, peace be upon him and his family, from whom Allah has removed impurity. O Allah, send blessings upon the remnant of Allah, the Imam of our time, our guardian, our master, our beloved, and the proof of Allah, the straight path, may the souls of the worlds be sacrificed for him.

Thereafter, our master and leader, Al-Hussain ibn Ali (peace be upon them), said:

مَن عَبَدَ اللَّهَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِهِ، آتَاهُ اللَّهُ فَوقَ أَمَانِيهِ وَكِفَايَتِهِ
"Whoever worships Allah as He deserves to be worshipped, Allah will give him more than he desires and suffices."
- [Reference needed]

Our master, Al-Hussain ibn Ali (peace be upon them), has spoken the truth. Blessings of Allah be upon the master of the martyrs.

#### The Purpose of Worship and Divine Grant

In this noble Hadith (prophetic tradition), Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) states that "مَن عَبَدَ اللَّهَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِهِ" (Whoever worships Allah as He deserves to be worshipped), if a person performs worship in that specific, deserved way, "آتَاهُ اللَّهُ فَوقَ أَمَانِيهِ وَكِفَايَتِهِ" (Allah will give him more than he desires and suffices). This means Allah will grant him so much, and bestow so much upon him, that he cannot even wish for it. He will receive more than his wishes and more than his needs, beyond what he even asks for.

The master of the martyrs, Imam Hussain (peace be upon him), is pointing to a very important concept in this Hadith. This Hadith is narrated in `Majmu'ah al-Warram`, where the late Warram has recorded this tradition. In it, the master of the martyrs says that whoever worships Allah in such a way, what does it mean to worship Allah in such a way? It means that he becomes completely dedicated to Allah. He becomes Allah's. That is why it is found in another tradition:

مَن كانَ لِلهِ كانَ اللهُ لَهُ
"Whoever is for Allah, Allah is for him."
- [Reference needed]

Now, if Allah becomes someone's, then that person does not need anyone else in the world. And this is the same idea that the master of the martyrs conveys in another Hadith, which Sheikh Saduq has narrated in his book `Ilal al-Shara'i`.

### Unveiling the True Purpose of Creation: From Worship to Ma'rifat

As you know, the verse of the Quran in Surah Al-Dhariyat (51:56) states:

وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنْسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ
"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me."
- [Quran, Surah Al-Dhariyat 51:56]

Allah is stating that He has created jinn and mankind solely for His worship. He created them for the purpose of worship. Now, in this regard, the master of the martyrs, Imam Hussain (peace be upon him), explains:

إِنَّ اللَّهَ جَلَّ ذِكْرُهُ مَا خَلَقَ الْعِبَادَ إِلَّا لِيَعْرِفُوهُ
"Indeed, Allah, glorified be His remembrance, did not create the servants except that they should know Him."
- [Reference needed]

Allah did not create people, did not create servants, except so that they may attain His Ma'rifat (Recognition or Knowledge). What is written in the Quran? That He created them for worship. How is the master of the martyrs explaining it? That He created them for Ma'rifat, so that they may recognize Him.

#### Ma'rifat as the Essence of Worship

فَإِذَا عَرَفُوهُ عَبَدُوهُ
"So when they know Him, they worship Him."
- [Reference needed]

When they attain His Ma'rifat, then they will truly worship Him. Which worship? This is "حَقَّ عِبَادَتِهِ" (the worship that is His due). This right can only be fulfilled when a person recognizes Allah as He deserves to be recognized. At that time, when he recognizes Allah, then he will worship Allah as He deserves to be worshipped.

#### Achieving Self-Sufficiency Through Divine Recognition

فَاسْتَغْنَوْا بِعِبَادَتِهِ عَنْ عِبَادَةِ مَنْ سِوَاهُ
"Then, by His worship, they become needless of the worship of anyone other than Him."
- [Reference needed]

Then he will not be in need of worshipping anyone other than Allah. He will not bow his head before anyone. The people of the world often bow their heads before others, but he who has the Ma'rifat of Allah, who recognizes Allah, will never bow his head before anyone other than Allah. He will never ask from anyone else, except from Allah, and he will not stretch out his hand before anyone else. That is, when we say that he did not stretch out his hand before anyone other than Allah, it does not mean that he should only ask from Allah for the sake of theory. No, it means that he should ask from the one whom Allah has made His Wasilah (Means of Approach). That is, the one whom Allah Himself has said in the Quran, Allah says that you should seek a Wasilah to Him. You go and seek a Wasilah to Allah.

#### The Obligation of Seeking Wasilah (Means of Approach)

وَابْتَغُوا إِلَيْهِ الْوَسِيلَةَ
"And seek the means of approach to Him."
- [Quran, Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:35]

Seeking, that is, making a Wasilah, is Allah's work. Searching for the Wasilah is the servants' work. What a profound point! Making a Wasilah is Allah's work, and searching for it is the servants' work.

So the Imam says, "عبادته" (His worship). Now a person stood up and asked:

يَا ابْنَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ بِأَبِي أَنْتَ وَأُمِّي فَمَا مَعْرِفَةُ اللَّهِ؟
"O son of the Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, what is the Ma'rifat of Allah?"
- [Reference needed]

What is the Ma'rifat of Allah? This was his question.

### Identifying True Ma'rifat: The Imam of One's Time

So the master of the martyrs replied:

مَعْرِفَةُ أَهْلِ كُلِّ زَمَانٍ إِمَامَهُمْ
"The Ma'rifat of the people of every age is their Imam."
- [Reference needed]

This means the Ma'rifat of the Imam of their time. This is the thing that Allah has made obligatory on everyone.

الَّذِي يَجِبُ عَلَيْهِمْ طَاعَتُهُ
"The one whose obedience is obligatory upon them."
- [Reference needed]

Now see, where did the discussion start from? From the Ma'rifat of Allah, from the worship of Allah, from the Ma'rifat of Allah, and where did it reach? The Imam explained that it is the Ma'rifat of the Imam of one's time.

#### The Imam as the Guide to True Monotheism and Worship

What is the reason for this? The reason is that the Imam is the one who teaches the way of Ma'rifat. The Imam is the one who teaches the way of worship. The Imam is the one who introduces and explains the correct Tawhid (Monotheism). He tells what the correct Tawhid is. If someone does not go to the door of the Imam, does not go to the door of the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them), then he will not get the correct Tawhid, nor will he get the correct Ma'rifat, nor will his worship be correct.

#### The Indispensable Link: Hadith al-Thaqalayn

And this is the saying of the Prophet himself; it is not merely an opinion. It is a very famous Hadith, which every child is familiar with, which is called Hadith al-Thaqalayn. The Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) said this Hadith several times, and it has been narrated in different words, collectively known as Hadith al-Thaqalayn, in which the Prophet said:

إِنِّي تَارِكٌ فِيكُمُ الثَّقَلَيْنِ كِتَابَ اللَّهِ وَعِتْرَتِي أَهْلَ بَيْتِي
"I am leaving among you two weighty things: the Book of Allah and my progeny, my Ahlul Bayt."
- [Reference needed]

I am leaving among you two valuable things, two very precious things: one is the Book of Allah and the other is my Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them). As long as you hold fast to both of them, hold them firmly, you will never go astray after me. This is because "they will not separate from each other until they come to me at the pool of Kawthar." So this is the command of the Prophet, the order of the Prophet, that you should hold fast to the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them). As long as a person does not hold fast to the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them), he cannot get salvation.

#### The Ahlul Bayt: Ark of Salvation and Gate of Forgiveness

That is why the example of the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them) is given as the example of the ark of Noah. That is why the example of the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them) is given as the example of Bab al-Hittah (the gate of forgiveness). What is the ark of Noah? It is said about it:

مَنْ رَكِبَهَا نَجَا
"Whoever boards it will be saved."
- [Reference needed]

What is the example of my Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them)?

مَثَلُ أَهْلِ بَيْتِي كَمَثَلِ سَفِينَةِ نُوحٍ
"The example of my Ahlul Bayt is like the example of the ark of Noah."
- [Reference needed]

The example of my Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them) is the example of the ark of Noah. Whoever boards this ark will be saved, and whoever stays behind will be destroyed, will be ruined. Therefore, it is very important to hold fast to the hem of the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them). So what does this mean? What is the concept? To hold fast to the hem of the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them) means to learn their teachings, that is, the teachings of the Quran and the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them), and to act upon them.

### The Pinnacle of Faith: Knowledge and Action

The Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) himself says:

يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ
"O people," know that the perfection of religion is this, perfection means the thing that is absolutely perfect, its pinnacle, its glory, its pinnacle, its top, its peak. What is the peak of religion? It is that you acquire knowledge and act upon it.

إِنَّ كَمَالَ الدِّينِ طَلَبُ الْعِلْمِ وَالْعَمَلُ بِهِ
"Indeed, the perfection of religion is to seek knowledge and act upon it."
- [Reference needed]

Seek knowledge, and act upon it. Therefore, when we study this Hadith, which you have just seen, Ma'rifat is a very important thing. Allah has sent man to acquire Ma'rifat. See, the first Hadith that was just recited before you, God willing, if Allah gives me the ability, the topic of the entire Majlis (gathering) will be this: what is the importance of Imamate? But we will try, God willing, to approach it in the way that the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them) have described. We will try to explain it slowly, slowly, as the master of the martyrs himself has said, that if a person worships Allah, which is the right of worship, Allah will grant him beyond his desires.

#### Divine Generosity Beyond Human Desire

See, to understand this Hadith, you have to understand the meaning of the word "tamanna" in Arabic. In fact, in Arabic it is called "tamanni", in Urdu we say "tamanna". So this "tamanna", in Arabic, you know what it means? In Arabic, when they say "tamanna", it means to wish for something, to desire something that is impossible for him, that he cannot achieve, that is very difficult for him, but his heart desires that he should get that thing. This is called "tamanna". That is, in Arabic, "tamanni" or "amani" means that he wants to get something. The Imam says that if he worships Allah, Allah will give him beyond his "tamanna". That is, the thing that he considers impossible, he is just thinking that if I get this thing, how good it would be. So Allah will give him that. So now the importance of this Ma'rifat will be clear to you, God willing, that this Ma'rifat is a very important thing.

### The Three Pillars of Ma'rifat: Fitrah, 'Aql, and Prophethood

See, this Ma'rifat that we have been commanded in this world, again and again, our Muhaddithin (scholars of Hadith) have mentioned it in their books with different names, which they call "Ma'rifah Tarkibi" (acquired knowledge), "Ma'rifah Thanawi" (secondary knowledge), in this way they have given different names. That is, this is the Ma'rifat that a servant acquires after coming into this world. That is, Allah has given him Ma'rifat, before coming into this world, man was in another world, which in the language of Hadith is called `Alam al-Zar` (the world of particles). He was in that `Alam al-Zar`, and in that `Alam al-Zar`, Allah introduced Himself to him, and not only introduced Himself, but Allah created him on this Ma'rifat, on this recognition.

#### The Innate Human Nature (Fitrah) for Divine Recognition

And this is the 30th verse of Surah Al-Rum, in which Allah says:

فَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا فِطْرَتَ اللَّهِ الَّتِي فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا
"So set your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. The nature of Allah upon which He has created people."
- [Quran, Surah Ar-Rum 30:30]

Turn your face towards Allah and become a Hanif. Hanif means straight, turn your face towards Allah. "فِطْرَتَ اللَّهِ الَّتِي فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا" (The nature of Allah upon which He has created people). Fitrah means creation. Fitrah means to create. The Fitrah, the nature on which Allah has created man, what is that nature? It is the Ma'rifat of Allah, it is Tawhid. This is the nature on which Allah has created man and sent him into this world. That is, we were in another world before this, that is a separate topic, which is very vast, very extensive, which is not our topic right now, but when Allah sent us into this world, He placed some responsibilities on us. And what is that responsibility? That in this world, we should reawaken that Fitrah, that Ma'rifat, and acquire it again through our deeds, through our actions.

And for this, see, this is a very important point, and a very important discussion. If this is understood by the children, we will try to explain it in very simple words, so that the children can understand it. See, Allah has made this Ma'rifat, Ma'rifat means knowledge, Ma'rifat means recognition, that is, to recognize. Allah has made it obligatory to recognize Allah, to recognize His Messenger, and to recognize your Imam. These three people, these three personalities, to recognize these three people, that is, to recognize Allah, to recognize the Messenger, and to recognize the Imam, this is all obligatory. It is obligatory, there is no exception in it. There is no exception in it, it is the duty of everyone, it is an obligation on everyone.

And the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), in the first sermon of `Nahj al-Balaghah`, explains this. See, we will slowly read the sentences of this sermon and explain them to the children, so that they know how Allah has arranged it. But it is possible that this topic may seem to many people that, what is this topic? It is very dry. But if you read it, if you read `Nahj al-Balaghah` yourself, then this matter will become clear to you that the aim of our creation is this. The purpose of our creation is this. And if someone does not achieve this purpose, then his life is like that of animals. In fact, it is written in the Quran that it is worse than animals. That is, if he does not achieve this purpose, this aim, then what example is given of him? The example of animals is given. And what is their abode mentioned in the Quran? Hell is mentioned. The Quran has said that they have intellect, but they do not use it. They have eyes, but they do not see with them. They have ears, but they do not hear with them. They are like animals. They are like animals. In fact, what is it?

بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ
"Nay, they are more astray."
- [Quran, Surah Al-A'raf 7:179]

They are worse than animals. But what happened? What was the tragedy? The tragedy was that the Shias were kept away from the Hadiths. Their own people kept them away, not others. By saying this, "Oh, we don't understand the Hadiths. Understanding the Hadiths is not our job. The Hadiths are not for us." If the Imams did not narrate the Hadiths for the Shias, then for whom did they narrate them? If `Nahj al-Balaghah` is not for the Shias, then for whom is it? Therefore, see, for this reason, although there are many traditions in this regard, very many, but we are bringing only one Hadith to you, and we will try to explain it slowly, so that the matter becomes clear to the youth, to the children.

The Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) says that a time came when all of humanity was completely misguided, completely astray, as the Quran has said in Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 213, all of humanity was completely misguided. Then the master says that Allah sent messengers to mankind, messengers, that is, messengers. Allah sent messengers.

وَبَعَثَ فِيهِمْ رُسُلَهُ
"And He sent among them His messengers."
- [Reference needed, likely Nahj al-Balaghah, Sermon 1]

These are the words of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), yes, not ours. And one after another, Allah sent prophets.

وَوَاتَرَ إِلَيْهِمْ أَنْبِيَاءَهُ
"And He sent His prophets to them in succession."
- [Reference needed, likely Nahj al-Balaghah, Sermon 1]

Consecutively, constantly, without any gap, Allah kept sending them, in a continuous manner, one after another. Why did He send them? The master says:

لِيَسْتَأْدُوهُمْ مِيثَاقَ فِطْرَتِهِ
"That they might ask them to fulfill the covenant of His nature."
- [Reference needed, likely Nahj al-Balaghah, Sermon 1]

So that He may make them fulfill, make them fulfill, the covenant of nature. The covenant, that is, the promise that we all made in the Fitrah, that is, in that `Alam al-Zar`, before coming into this world, the promise of our Fitrah, which is still present in our Fitrah, in everyone, whether he is a Hindu, or a Muslim, or a Christian, or a Sikh, whoever he may be, whether he is a resident of India, or a resident of Africa, or a resident of America, any person in the world, Allah has created everyone on this nature, which is called the God-knowing nature. So the master says that the prophets came on this nature to remind them that, look, why were you created? You think about this, you reflect on this, why you have come into this world. Just to eat, to drink, to earn money, to settle down, even an animal does that. The smallest animal, the largest animal, it understands all these things. A bird also understands that it has to eat, it has to drink, everyone understands that. There is no such thing that does not understand this. Every living being understands it. So the thing that separates man from animals and birds and other things is that he recognizes Allah and knows the way to worship Him. He should recognize Allah and understand the way to worship Him, and through this, he should get closer to Allah, become close to Allah. So the master says, that covenant, that promise, that covenant, that promise that Allah had taken, the prophets came to fulfill that promise. The prophets came so that you people may fulfill that promise.

أَلَمْ أَعْهَدْ إِلَيْكُمْ يَا بَنِي آدَمَ أَنْ لَا تَعْبُدُوا الشَّيْطَانَ
"Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you should not worship Satan?"
- [Quran, Surah Ya-Sin 36:60]

In Surah Yasin, I have taken a promise from you that you will worship only Me and not worship anyone else. You will not worship anyone other than Allah. So here the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) says, "مِيثَاقَ فِطْرَتِهِ" (the covenant of His nature).

#### The Indispensable Role of Intellect ('Aql)

And the treasures of intellect (`Aql`) that are present in their being, the treasures of intellect, see, the thing that separates man from other creatures, from other creatures, is the intellect. So now see, the master is mentioning three important things in this Hadith. Remember, there are three important things. One is Fitrah, two is 'Aql (intellect), and three are the prophets and messengers. These three things are very important. That is, these three things are the ones through which a person can acquire "Ma'rifah Tarkibi", that is, the Ma'rifat that Allah has given, he can recognize Allah, he can recognize the Messenger, he can recognize his Imam, and he can achieve the purpose of his life. See, the discussion we are having today is very fundamental, very basic. If this matter is understood, God willing, then the next discussion will be very easy, God willing. Now this may seem a little difficult to you, a little dry, because this topic is very rarely discussed, there are very few talks on the Hadiths, that is why we are presenting this to you, we are explaining it a little. So Allah, that is, the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) says, these are three important things. Allah sent the messengers, one for Ma'rifat, to recognize Allah and the Messenger and the Imam. The most important thing is the coming of the messengers. The second thing is Fitrah, that is, the thing in which Allah has created all creatures, especially human beings. And the third thing is 'Aql. Now remember this, 'Aql is the third thing, and this is very important. That is, if a person does not have 'Aql, then the coming of the messenger will not benefit him, and his Fitrah will not benefit him either. Nothing will benefit him if he does not have 'Aql.

Now remember, in the religion of the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them), in the teachings of the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them), the importance that has been given to 'Aql has not been given to any other thing. And the rest of the religions or faiths that are prevalent in the world today, whenever you talk to them, when the matter of 'Aql comes, they will turn away from the matter of 'Aql in religion. They will say, "Brother, don't talk about 'Aql in this, this is not a matter of 'Aql, there is no 'Aql in this." But the Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them) have emphasized in this that, look, nothing is going to happen without 'Aql. Subhanallah (Glory be to God). That is, the prophets also came only to explain through 'Aql. The prophets came only to talk to the intelligent. The prophets did not come to talk to the foolish. Subhanallah. The prophets did not come to talk to the ignorant. The prophets did not come to talk to those who have put their 'Aql on the shelf. Subhanallah.

#### Quranic Affirmation of Intellect

But we see that in the Holy Quran, there are so many verses on 'Aql, so many verses, that you will hardly turn a page of the Quran in which 'Aql has not been addressed, 'Aql has not been addressed. The whole Quran is full of it. Now you see, we will present two or three verses to you, just quickly, we will present them very quickly. The Quran says that:

إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَاخْتِلَافِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ لَآيَاتٍ لِأُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ
"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, are signs for those of understanding."
- [Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:164 or Ali 'Imran 3:190]

In the creation of this heaven and earth, and in the coming and going of the nights, there are signs in it, signs, for whom? For the people of intellect. Those who have intellect, they understand that someone has created them. Without if someone has not created them, they have not come into existence on their own. There is a creator for them. And the meaning of "ulil-albab" is, the meaning of "lubb" is intellect. This is a sign for the people of intellect. After that, it is said in another verse that Allah says:

وَكَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ
"And thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you might use reason."
- [Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:242]

And Allah explains the signs to you in this way, He explains these signs, all the signs of this world, so that you may use your intellect, use your intellect. Or the Quran says:

أَفَلَا يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَى الْإِبِلِ كَيْفَ خُلِقَتْ
"Then do they not look at the camels - how they are created?"
- [Quran, Surah Al-Ghashiyah 88:17]

Do they not see the camel, how it was created? How was the camel created? Or how was the sky raised? Or how was the earth spread out? Or how were the mountains made? How were they installed? O Prophet, you remind them, you just remind them. Your job is only to remind. So the Prophet was only reminding, he was giving a reminder, so that people would pay attention in this way that someone has created us. Someone has created us. And the one who has created us, has created us for a purpose.

#### The Ultimate Accountability and Purpose of Life

The Quran says, the Quran asks a question from the intellect of man:

أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ
"Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?"
- [Quran, Surah Al-Mu'minun 23:115]

Do you think that We have created you in vain? Just come into the world and eat, drink, play, and that's it? And then you will not be returned to Us? There will be no reckoning? There will be no questioning? There will be no accountability? All these things will happen. Every single person will be asked, what did you do in the world? And he will be questioned for every single minute, he will be questioned for every single thing. This is what the Quran is asking. The Quran is asking this question. "لَا تُرْجَعُونَ" (you would not be returned). Do you think that you will not be returned to Us? "لَا تُرْجَعُونَ" (you would not be returned), this is in Arabic in the passive voice, that you will not be brought back? You will be brought back by force. No, if you don't even feel like going, you will still be taken by force. If the angel of death comes and says, "Let's go," and you say, "I don't want to go," you can't stop by your saying.

#### The Vulture's Cry: A Reminder of Mortality

In the world, that is why it is in the Hadith of the master of the martyrs that they say, the vulture, you know, the vulture, in Arabic it is called "nasr", nun sin ra, "nasr", vulture. The vulture, you know, it makes a strange sound, you know, it screams. You know, right? And especially when it sees a dead body, you know, you see how the vulture, the vulture, how it pounces on the carcass, you know, and makes a strange sound. The master of the martyrs says, "Do you know what this sound is saying? What is this vulture saying?" The master, Imam Hussain (peace be upon him), says, "It says, 'O you who live in this world, your ultimate end is this.'" Wow, wow, Subhanallah. You have to go here. You have to reach here. Everyone has to die. Everyone has to answer. There is no one who will remain in the world forever. Anyway, all these verses, all these traditions, there are many in this regard, there are many Hadiths, that Allah has said to man that you should reflect on yourself, think, you are the servant of Allah, you have been created, you are the creation of Allah. There are many Hadiths in this regard. And if a person reflects on this, then this matter will come to his understanding that how important it is for him to use his intellect, how much it is necessary.

### The Intellect's Path to Imamate and Muharram's Grief

But anyway, God willing, we will continue this series tomorrow if Allah gives us the ability and life, that now that Allah has given intellect, how should we use this intellect to recognize Allah, to recognize His Messenger, and then to recognize our Imam, and how Imamate is proven through intellect. The Imamate of the 12 Imams is proven through intellect. And if a person does not use his intellect, then his example is the same as that of animals.

Let's wrap up the discussion here today, let's end it. It is the first night of Muharram, the night of the new moon, and this is the moon that every believer weeps and laments upon seeing. This is the night when the Imams would wear black clothes and weep, and they would weep in such a way that they would neither sleep peacefully nor sit peacefully, but only weep and lament.

#### The Enduring Tragedy of Karbala and Its Lessons

It is found in the traditions, in the Hadith, that Rayyan ibn Shabib came to Imam Reza (peace be upon him) during the days of mourning. The Imam said, "O Shabib, if you ever feel like crying over something, then cry over my grandfather Hussain, peace be upon him. For Hussain was slaughtered in the same way that lambs are slaughtered." The Ahlul Bayt (peace be upon them) and 18 members of the Banu Hashim were slaughtered with them, they were killed. O Rayyan ibn Shabib, there is no other example of them in the universe. They are the ones for whom the heavens and the earth used to weep, they weep. O son of Shabib, therefore, weep for them.

#### Imam Reza's Counsel on Grieving for Imam Hussain

They say that I came to Imam Reza (peace be upon him) during the days of mourning. The Imam said, "O Debal, recite the Marsiya of Hussain." Debal began to recite the Marsiya, and suddenly the sound of women screaming was heard from behind the curtain, and the women wept so much that they were fainting upon hearing the calamities. I will say to the ladies of the household, "Oh, you have only heard the calamities and you have started screaming. Oh, just come to Karbala, come in the afternoon of Ashura, see how Zainab is enduring the calamities. Zainab's heart is breaking, and she is saying, 'O son of Sajjad, you are seeing my brother being killed.'"

#### The Profound Grief of the Ahlul Bayt

O Lord, hasten the reappearance of the Imam of our time, peace be upon him. O Lord, hasten the reappearance of the Imam of our time. O Lord, count us among his helpers and supporters. Those who are in distress, remove their distress. Those who are in debt, pay off their debts. Those who are far from their homeland, return them safe and sound. Wherever the Shias of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) are in the world, protect their lives, property, honor, and dignity. Protect the great scholars and the sources of emulation. Protect the holy sites and those who protect them. Grant us the Ziyarat (pilgrimage) of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad in this world, and the intercession of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad in the hereafter. Matam of Hussain.
