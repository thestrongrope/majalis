## Content

Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him, states in a hadith:

رَحِمَ اللَّهُ عَبْدًا مَنْ يَعْرِفُ قَدْرَهُ وَلَمْ يَتَعَدَّى حَدَّهُ.
May Allah have mercy on a servant who knows his worth and value and does not exceed his limits, does not cross his boundaries.

This teaching is of great importance. If a person recognizes their own worth and value, it leads to understanding their position.

### The Importance of Self-Recognition and Understanding One's Worth

#### Imam Ali's (a.s.) Counsel on Knowing One's Worth

This hadith from Imam Ali (a.s.) emphasizes the crucial concept of self-recognition and staying within one's bounds. This forms the foundational understanding for appreciating the true status bestowed upon the followers of the Ahlul Bayt (Holy Household).

#### The Shia as the Best of Creation

The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, says:

يَا عَلِيُّ أَنْتَ وَشِيعَتُكَ خَيْرُ الْبَرِيَّةِ.
O Ali, you and your Shia are the best of creation.
- [Reference needed]

`Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) This title, `خَيْرُ الْبَرِيَّةِ` (Khayrul Bariyyah - best of creation), has come in the Quran, and its manifestation is Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, and his Shia. This hadith was chosen so that we may understand what our worth is, what our value is.

#### The True Reality of the Shia

Firstly, there is a very deep discussion here that will not be delved into right now, but it concerns how our creation came about – how were the Shia created? What was their genesis? That is why, when a man came to the Sixth Imam, Imam Jafar Sadiq, peace be upon him:

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ وَالْعَنْ أَعْدَاءَهُمْ.
O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance, and curse their enemies.

The man stated that there are many disagreements among the Shia; they have many discords and disunity. The Imam did not say, "No, you must remain united. You must live together in harmony." He did not say any of that. Instead, what did the Imam say? He said that if these people knew the origin of their creation, they would never fight among themselves. Their problem is that they are unaware of their own creation; they are unaware of their true reality. `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) If they were aware of their reality, they would never speak in such a manner.

### The Luminous Status of the Shia in the Heavens

This brings us to another hadith, which will now be shared, from Imam Musa Kazim, peace be upon him:

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ وَالْعَنْ أَعْدَاءَهُمْ.
O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance, and curse their enemies.

The Imam states:

كَانَ قَوْمٌ مِنْ خَوَاصِّ الصَّادِقِ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ جُلُوسٌ بِحَضْرَتِهِ فِي لَيْلَةٍ مُقْمِرَةٍ مَسْحِيَّةٍ.
A group of the special companions of Imam Jafar Sadiq, peace be upon him, were sitting in his presence on a moonlit, clear night.
- [Reference needed]

That is, the special Shia of Imam Jafar Sadiq, peace be upon him, were seated with him. Not just ordinary people, but his special companions. When it says "special" here, it means those who were very learned, of a very high rank, or, in common language, jurists, scholars, great `Ulama` (scholars). These were individuals of immense stature, one better than the next.

And what kind of night was it? It was `ليلة البدر` (Laylat al-Badr - the night of the full moon), meaning the fourteenth moon, shining with its full brilliance. The entire sky was illuminated. The full moon was out. This is called `ليلة المقمرة` (Laylat al-Muqmarah). (`Muqmarah` is derived from `qamar` meaning moon.) So, the moon was out, shining brightly; it was a full moon night. And `مسحِيَّة` (Mas-hiyyah) means the sky was absolutely clear. There were no clouds in the sky at all. So, this is a very beautiful scene, when the full moon is out, the sky is perfectly clear, with no clouds.

When the companions saw this:

فَقَالُوا يَا ابْنَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ مَا أَحْسَنَ هَذِهِ السَّمَاءَ!
So they said, "O son of the Messenger of Allah, how beautiful is this sky!"
- [Reference needed]

See! `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) The companions said this. And remember, these were not children. They were special companions. They said, "O son of the Messenger of Allah, look how beautiful the sky is!"

وَاَنْوَرُ هَذِهِ النُّجُومُ وَالْكَوَاكِبُ!
And how bright are these stars and planets!
- [Reference needed]

Now, because the moon was also out, the stars were sparkling, the celestial bodies were shining. The sky had a tremendous, unique beauty. It had a unique light, a unique glow. So, upon seeing this, these companions were completely entranced, spellbound by how magnificent and beautiful the sky was.

#### Angelic Observation of the Shia's Light

Now listen to Imam's response. What was it?

فَقَالَ الصَّادِقُ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ.
So Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him, said:
- [Reference needed]

"Are you saying this? Are you uttering such words?"

إِنَّكُمْ لَتَقُولُونَ هَذَا وَإِنَّ الْمُدَبِّرَاتِ الْأَرْبَعَةَ
You are saying this, while the four managing angels,
- [Reference needed]

—meaning Allah's four `مدبرات` (Mudabbiraat - managing angels). `مدبرات` (Mudabbiraat) meaning those who manage. This is a Quranic verse, Surah An-Nazi'at, verse five, where Allah says in the Quran:

وَالْمُدَبِّرَاتِ أَمْرًا.
And those who manage the affairs.
- [Surah An-Nazi'at, 79:5]

These are the four main ones who run the system of the entire universe: Jibraeel (Gabriel), Mikaeel (Michael), Azraeel (Azrael), Israfeel (Raphael). These are the four. These four are the main ones, also called `ملائكة مقرب` (Malā’ikat al-Muqarrab - cherubim), Allah's closest angels. So, when these angels—the Imam says—these four important angels, their status, their position, is very great. These four angels run the entire system of the universe.

The Imam says, "These Jibraeel, Mikaeel, Israfeel, and the Angel of Death, Azraeel, peace be upon them,"

يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ وَيَرَوْنَ فَيَرَوْنَكُمْ وَإِخْوَانَكُمْ فِي أَقْطَارِ الْأَرْضِ.
They look towards the earth and they see you and your brothers in the corners of the earth.
- [Reference needed]

وَنُورُكُمْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ
And your light in the heavens.
- [Reference needed]

`Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) Just imagine, your light.

#### Human Perception and the Removal of Veils

Look, there are many things that we don't understand. Because Allah has kept our intellect very limited in this world. That is, we can see very few things in this world. That's why one name given to this world in hadiths is `دنیا حجاب کی دنیا` (Dunya Hijab ki Dunya - the world of veils). It is a world of veils, meaning many things are not visible to us or are not understood by us, just as our own soul is not understood by us.

Isn't that clear? That's why there's a verse in Surah Qaf where Allah says:

لَقَدْ كُنْتَ فِي غَفْلَةٍ مِنْ هَذَا
Indeed, you were heedless of this.
- [Surah Qaf, 50:22]

This is Surah Qaf, verse 22.

لَقَدْ كُنْتَ فِي غَفْلَةٍ مِنْ هَذَا فَكَشَفْنَا عَنْكَ غِطَاءَكَ فَبَصَرُكَ الْيَوْمَ حَدِيدٌ.
Indeed, you were heedless of this, but now We have removed your cover from you, so your sight today is sharp.
- [Surah Qaf, 50:22]

When will this be said? When death is near. When the Angel of Death stands before you to seize your soul. At that moment, Allah says: "You were heedless of this until now." Heedless, meaning negligent. "Until now, you were in negligence, you were negligent." Now your vision will become sharp. Meaning, whatever you couldn't see in the world until now, you will see it all now. And that is why, when the veil is removed from a person, they will see many things. For example, they will see the Angel of Death, they will see Barzakh (the intermediate realm), they will see everything. They will see this entire Barzakh, a daunting disclosure will come upon them. Meaning, there will be a strange state. And that is why, this is for whom? This is for ordinary people. For ordinary people, for all human beings.

But Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him, says:

لَوْ كُشِفَ الْغِطَاءُ مَا ازْدَدْتُ يَقِينًا.
If the veil were lifted, my certainty would not increase.
- [Reference needed]

If veils were removed, Ali's certainty would not increase. `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!)

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ.
O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance.

Even if veils are removed, it makes no difference to Ali. There is no veil for Ali, nothing. Wow, wow, wow. `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!)

#### The Unique Brightness of the Shia's Light

So, the Imam says: "Your light is so bright, shining in the earth and shining in the heavens." Those in the heavens, when they see your light, they see that

وَإِلَيْهِمْ أَحْسَنُ مِنْ نُورِ هَذِهِ الْكَوَاكِبِ.
And to them, it is better than the light of these stars.
- [Reference needed]

They see that your light is brighter than the light of these stars, brighter than the light of the moon, brighter than the light of these celestial bodies, brighter than the light of these planets, these stars, in the heavens. This is greater than that.

"وَفِي أَقْطَارِ الْأَرْضِ نُورٌ أَحْسَنُ مِنْ نُورِ هَذِهِ الْكَوَاكِبِ وَإِنَّهُمْ يَقُولُونَ كَمَا تَقُولُونَ."
And in the corners of the earth, there is a light better than the light of these stars, and they say as you say.
- [Reference needed]

And just as you are saying now, "How, how bright is this sky," so too Jibraeel, Mikaeel, Israfeel, and Azraeel, when they see your light, they say, "How wonderfully bright these people are!" Wow, wow, wow. `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!)

And especially, this light gets its fragrance when gatherings like these are arranged, are held. When such gatherings are held, some angels, who are blessed, whose good fortune it is to participate in this gathering, when they leave from here, when the gathering ends, other angels meet them and ask, "Where are you coming from? Such a fragrance!" `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!)

Anyway, this is a very great blessing that we should understand. Firstly, in terms of our creation, and secondly, that Allah has given us this success, this `توفیق` (Tawfeeq - divine grace), to participate in gatherings of [Imam] Hussain, peace be upon him. This is a very great blessing. And truly, if we have received this blessing, it is the grace of the `Ahlul Bayt` (Holy Household), peace be upon them. It is not that we have any eligibility. We have no entitlement, no merit. This is their grace. This is their gift. Because of which, today, we have received this blessing to sit here and mention [Imam] Hussain, peace be upon him.

#### The Esteemed Status of `Huddath al-Hussain` (Narrators of Hussain)

And those who participate in such gatherings, in the hadiths, they are given a title, a name. They are called:

`حُدَّاثُ الْحُسَيْنِ.`
The Narrators of Hussain.
- [Reference needed]

`حُدَّاثُ الْحُسَيْنِ.` (Huddath al-Hussain). In hadith, they are called `حُدَّاثُ الْحُسَيْنِ` (Huddath al-Hussain). What does `حُدَّاثُ الْحُسَيْنِ` (Huddath al-Hussain) mean? It means those who mention [Imam] Hussain, peace be upon him. What a statement! `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) It's strange, but what a word. And why is this title given? What is the reason for `حُدَّاثُ الْحُسَيْنِ` (Huddath al-Hussain)?

The reason is that on the Day of Judgment, when everyone goes to paradise, there will be some special individuals who will not enter paradise. Instead, they will sit outside paradise and establish the remembrance of [Imam] Hussain, peace be upon him. `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) The remembrance of [Imam] Hussain, peace be upon him. And these are the words of the hadith, not our words. The pleasure they will derive from this remembrance there, no other pleasure, no greater enjoyment, will compare to it.

So, recite a `Salawat` (blessing) once.

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ وَالْعَنْ أَعْدَاءَهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ.
O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance, and curse all their enemies.

Allah will tell the angels to tell them to enter paradise. So, the angels will come. They will say, "Come, enter paradise. There are many good bounties there." They will say, "The bounties we received here, from the remembrance of [Imam] Hussain, peace be upon him, nothing can compete with that." Then, after that, `Hoors` (celestial maidens) will come. And they will say, "Come, enter paradise." But the sentence in the hadith is that they won't even turn to the `Hoors`, they won't even pay attention. So much pleasure will they get. So, they are called `حُدَّاثُ الْحُسَيْنِ.` (Narrators of Hussain.) This is grace.

### The Rights of Shia and the Standard of Love and Hate for Allah's Sake

Now, listen to another hadith that is presented, which is that the Imam said: "The right of our Shia upon us is greater than our right upon them." This is strange! Reflect on this too. See what the hadith says.

The Imam states:

حُقُوقُ شِيعَتِنَا عَلَيْنَا أَوْجَبُ مِنْ حُقُوقِنَا عَلَيْهِمْ.
The rights of our Shia upon us are more obligatory than our rights upon them.
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, the rights of our Shia that they enjoy upon us are greater compared to the rights we have upon them. Strange! What does that mean?

"قِيلَ لَهُ وَكَيْفَ ذَلِكَ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ؟"
And it was said to him, "How is that, O Messenger of Allah?"
- [Reference needed]

You, the `Ahlul Bayt` (Holy Household)—peace be upon you—what is your status? What is your position? What are we? We are nothing before them. We are not even the dust of their doorstep. Not even the dust under the feet of their servants. But the Imam says that their right upon our necks is greater than our right upon them. This is a huge statement; do not take it lightly.

So, the companions who were sitting there, they also got disturbed hearing this. They started saying... yes, recite this `Salawat` (blessing).

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ وَالْعَنْ أَعْدَاءَهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ.
O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance, and curse all their enemies.

They asked, "How is it possible that the rights of the Shia are greater upon you? You are the Imam. And the Shia are the `Ma'moom` (followers). You are the leader; we are the followers. How can this be?"

#### The Greater Rights of the Shia

Reflect on what the Imam said in response:

"لِأَنَّهُمْ يُصَابُونَ فِينَا وَلَا نُصَابُ فِيهِمْ."
Because they suffer for our sake, and we do not suffer for their sake.
- [Reference needed]

Our Shia bear difficulties because of us. We do not bear difficulties because of them. They are put into hardships because of us. They are tormented. They are killed. They are imprisoned. The only reason is that they are the Shia of [Imam] Ali, peace be upon him. They are the Shia of [Imam] Haydar Karrar (the repeatedly attacking lion). They are the Shia of Ali ibn Abi Talib. That is why they are subjected to all these punishments.

#### Redefining 'Nasibi' (Hater of Ahlul Bayt)

They say, "This is a `Rafidhi` (rejector)." They should be punished. And that is why you know what the definition of `Nasibi` (hater of Ahlul Bayt) is. Generally, our understanding of `Nasibi` is someone who is an enemy of the `Ahlul Bayt`, peace be upon them. But when the Sixth Imam was asked what `Nasibi` means, the Imam said, "`Nasibi` does not mean one who is an enemy of the `Ahlul Bayt`. Because you will not find any Muslim who, while being a Muslim, claims to be an enemy of the `Ahlul Bayt`. No matter how much of an enemy he is, he will not say that he is an enemy of the `Ahlul Bayt`."

He will claim to love the `Ahlul Bayt`, but actually, he practices that enmity. And based on that, what does he do? He tortures the Shia. He causes suffering to the Shia. And that is why they write many books. They keep writing many books and do many tremendous things. As much as possible, they cause suffering. So, the Imam says that the rights of our Shia are greater because they endure hardships for our sake. We do not endure hardships for their sake. They have to endure.

#### The Obligation of Love and Hate for Allah (`Wujoob al-Hubb fillah wal Bughd fillah`)

That's why it has been commanded to love the Shia in all circumstances. Look, we have a belief, and this is a very important belief, but generally, this topic is not studied, and people are not familiar with it. But if you read books of hadith, there is a very important topic in them, which Sheikh Hurr al-Amili, a very great scholar and jurist, compiled in a book called `Wasail al-Shia`.

`Wasail al-Shia` is a book of hadith that is, currently, in 30 volumes. One volume is 300-400 pages. So, you can multiply to see how many pages that book is. Approximately, understand it to be 10-12 thousand pages, containing only hadiths, nothing else. And before every hadith, or every group of hadiths, he has given a `Fatwa` (religious ruling). And one `Fatwa` he brings states what is in the hadith.

And that is:

`وُجُوبُ الْحُبِّ فِي اللَّهِ وَالْبُغْضِ فِي اللَّهِ.`
The obligation of love for Allah and hatred for Allah's sake.
- [Reference needed]

It is obligatory that if you love, you love for the sake of Allah. And if you hate and show enmity, you do so for the sake of Allah. Neither love nor enmity should be for personal gain or personal motives. Meaning, if you love someone, you love them because they are a lover of the `Ahlul Bayt`. And if you show enmity towards someone, you do so because they are an enemy of the `Ahlul Bayt`. And if they are a friend of the `Ahlul Bayt`, no matter how great an enemy they are to us, we cannot show enmity towards them. And if they are an enemy of the `Ahlul Bayt`, no matter how great a friend they are to us, we cannot befriend them. No matter how many of our interests or goals are tied to them, we cannot befriend them.

That is why it is narrated that once when the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, delivered a hadith, someone asked, "Is love and hate part of religion?" He replied:

`هَلِ الدِّينُ إِلَّا الْحُبُّ وَالْبُغْضُ؟`
Is religion anything but love and hate?
- [Reference needed]

Is religion anything but love and hate? And this whole topic is a response to those who say, "No, we won't hate anyone; we will love everyone." They say this until it happens to them. When it happens to them, they truly start hating everyone. Then, no matter who it is, they will hate the other person.

#### Imam Ali (a.s.) as the Standard of Truth

But here, the standard has been explained. When the narrator asked the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, "What is meant by this? What is the purpose of loving whom and hating whom?" The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, said to Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him:

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ.
O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance.

"Love whoever loves him (Ali). Hate whoever hates him (Ali)."
- [Reference needed]

Ali was made the standard. In other words, the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, made truth the standard. `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) Ali is the truth, and the truth is Ali. Indeed. So, the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, set the standard: "Look, what is the standard? It is truth. Love the truth. And hate whoever deviates from the truth. And what is the standard of truth? Ali ibn Abi Talib." Even if, outwardly, it seems like anything to us, look, it might not be understandable to us.

### The Demands and Rewards of Being a True Shia

That's why, in your service, one more hadith will be read. This will probably be the last hadith for today, because you all are also tired. And there are many gatherings today, so we are keeping it brief. This hadith is from the son of Sayyid [Meesum al-Tammar], peace be upon him. The narrator is his son. Sayyid Meesum al-Tammar's son's name is Yaqub ibn Meesum. He was his son. You know Sayyid Meesum al-Tammar, peace be upon him, who was martyred, crucified. This is his son. He was a servant of [Imam] Zain al-Abidin, peace be upon him. The Imam's servant. The son of Meesum al-Tammar. The Fourth Imam, peace be upon him, freed him. Then he became a companion of the Fifth Imam, peace be upon him.

Now listen. This companion says that one day I was present in the service of the Fifth Imam, peace be upon him. And I said, "May my life be sacrificed for you, O son of the Messenger of Allah. I was reading the book of my father, Meesum al-Tammar." Did you notice? This means our tradition of books has been going on from the very beginning. It's not something that started 100-150 years later. We have books existing from Sayyid Meesum al-Tammar, peace be upon him. Books from Sayyid Malik al-Ashtar, peace be upon him. Books from Sayyid Dhuriyat al-Qays, peace be upon him. Books from Sayyid Abu Hamza al-Thumali, peace be upon him. Books from the first Hijri century exist. Our religion, our faith, is not something that started 100-150 years later.

#### The Uncompromising Nature of Love and Hate for Ahlul Bayt

So, he says, "I saw in my father's book, and it was written there that Ali, peace be upon him, said to my father, Meesum al-Tammar:

"أَحِبَّ حَبِيبَ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَإِنْ كَانَ فَاسِقًا زَانِيَةً."
Love the lover of the family of Muhammad, even if he is a corrupt person and an adulterer.
- [Reference needed]

`Allahu Akbar!` (God is the Greatest!) What a strange statement. These are not our words; these are the words of the hadith. If anyone objects, they object to the Imam, and whoever objects to the Imam is outside of religion. So, the Imam states—Commander of the Faithful—to whom does he say this? He says to Meesum al-Tammar, peace be upon him:

"أَحِبَّ حَبِيبَ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَإِنْ كَانَ فَاسِقًا زَانِيَةً."
Love the lover of the family of Muhammad, even if he is a corrupt person and an adulterer.

`Fasiq` (corrupt) refers to someone who openly commits sins. And `Zani` (adulterer) refers to someone who has committed adultery or immorality. Love him, if in his heart there is love for the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them. If he has not gone outside the religion of the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them.

And then he says:

"أَبْغِضْ مُبْغِضَ آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَإِنْ كَانَ صَوَّامًا قَوَّامَةً."
Hate the hater of the family of Muhammad, even if he is a constant faster and a constant worshiper.
- [Reference needed]

And hate the enemy of the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them, even if he is a frequent observer of fasts and a constant worshiper. He prays tremendously. He fasts tremendously. But in his belief, he is zero. In his belief, he is an enemy of the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them. He harbors enmity towards the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them. Should you love him? Should you help him? Should you incline towards him? Absolutely not. Not even a speck. If there is even a speck of inclination towards him, even a slight love, then it means there is a deficiency in faith. And I am not saying this on my own; it is all in the narrations.

And that is why we have a `Dua` (supplication) that the Imam says is our right upon our Shia: that they should not leave their prayer mat until they recite this `Dua`. It is a small `Dua` that has been narrated by the `Muhaddithun` (hadith narrators) in `Mustanbal Wasa'id`, and it is in Volume 5, Page 60. It is a small `Dua`. And that `Dua` is such that if you recite it, it takes barely 20 seconds, or half a minute maximum, no more. The Imam says that it is our right, the right of our lovers, upon their necks, that they will not leave the prayer mat until they recite this `Dua`. And the last sentence of this `Dua` is: "O Lord, curse those two, curse their daughters, and curse those who incline towards them, who are inclined towards them. Curse those who doubt their being disbelievers. Curse those who doubt." Some people say, "Anyhow, they were Muslims." No, no, merely saying it in English does not make them Muslims.

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ.
O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance.

وَادْنِ عَلَيْهِ.
And bring him close to him.
- [Reference needed]

So, that is what it is. Who is saying this? These are the words of the Master of the Universe, Commander of the Faithful; they are not ours.

#### The Quranic Affirmation of the Shia as the Best of Creation

`إِنِّي،` (Inni - Indeed, I) The Imam states, Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, is speaking. "I heard the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, say..."

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ.
O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance.

"الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ خَيْرُ الْبَرِيَّةِ."
Those who have believed and done righteous deeds, those are the best of creatures.
- [Surah Al-Bayyinah, 98:7]

This is Surah Al-Bayyinah, verse number seven (not four as mentioned, it is 98:7 for `أُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ خَيْرُ الْبَرِيَّةِ`). The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, recited this verse. Surah Al-Bayyinah. Surah Al-Bayyinah, its seventh verse. It's the last chapter, the last `Juz` (part) of the Quran. The last `Juz`. Its Surah Al-Bayyinah, its seventh verse. That `الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ أُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ خَيْرُ الْبَرِيَّةِ.` (Those who have believed and done good deeds, they are the best of creation of Allah.) `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) The best.

After reciting this verse:

`اِلْتَفَتَ إِلَيَّ.`
He turned to me.
- [Reference needed]

Who is saying this? Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, is stating this. "The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, turned towards me, faced me, and said:"

"وَاللَّهِ! أَنْتَ وَشِيعَتُكَ يَا عَلِيُّ، وَمِيعَادُكَ وَمِيعَادُهُمُ الْحَوْضُ غَدًا."
By Allah! By God, O Ali! You and your Shia, O Ali, and your meeting place and their meeting place is at the Pond [of Kauthar] tomorrow.
- [Reference needed]

Where will you and your Shia meet? Where will you meet? At `حَوْضُ الْكَوْثَرِ` (Hawdh al-Kawthar - the Pond of Kauthar). Your meeting time, your meeting place, is there. `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) `خَيْرُ الْبَرِيَّةِ` (Khayrul Bariyyah - The best of creation) are you people. There is no one else besides you. `خَيْرُ الْبَرِيَّةِ` (Khayrul Bariyyah) are you people.

#### The Qualities of the Shia and Their Meeting at Kauthar

And then he says: `مُحَجَّلِينَ.` (Muhajjaleen). These will be tremendous individuals. These Shia of yours. `Muhajjaleen` refers to horses that are purebred, of excellent lineage. You know, horses have breeds. So, those that are perfectly purebred are called `Muhajjaleen`. So, the Shia whose deeds are absolutely pure. `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) A Shia cannot be sinful or corrupt anyway.

And then he says: `مُتَوَّجِينَ.` (Mutawwajin). Every Shia will have a crown on their head. Who is narrating this hadith? The son of Sayyid Meesum is narrating this. Sayyid Meesum's son is saying that I read this hadith in my father's book. Why is he saying this? Is this hadith correct? He is asking if his father wrote correctly.

Now listen to the Fifth Imam's response. The Imam states:

"هَكَذَا هُوَ أَعْيَانًا فِي كِتَابِ عَلِيٍّ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ."
Thus it is, I found it clearly in the book of Ali, peace be upon him.
- [Reference needed]

`Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!)

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ.
O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance.

`Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) This is the status of the Shia. This is the position of the Shia. Wow, wow.

#### The Sacrifice and Patience Required for the Shia Station

But this is not an easy thing. Obviously, when any rank is high, it is not easy. It requires enduring many hardships. It requires tremendous effort. Just as it is narrated about the Master of the Universe, Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him:

`لَا تَأْخُذُهُ فِي اللَّهِ لَوْمَةُ لَائِمٍ.`
He does not fear the blame of a blamer for the sake of Allah.
- [Reference needed]

He would not pay attention to the blame of any blamer. Meaning, when he worked for Allah, he didn't care if someone felt bad or good. And similarly, the Shia used to be. For example, Yunus ibn Abdur Rahman, peace be upon him. Yunus ibn Abdur Rahman was one of the special companions of [Imam] Reza, peace be upon him. One day, what happened was that people from his hometown, from his village, came to meet [Imam] Reza, peace be upon him. From Yunus ibn Abdur Rahman's hometown. What did the Imam say to Yunus? "[Yunus], sit behind the curtain, so they don't see you. And remain absolutely silent, completely still." Yunus said, "Okay," and went and sat. Now, his village folk, his tribe members, came and started speaking ill of Yunus intensely. They spoke a lot of bad things. The Imam also listened silently. The Imam did not say anything to them. They kept on saying, "[Yunus] is like this, [Yunus] does this." The Imam let them speak fully, so that Yunus could hear what their opinion of him was. Yunus should know what they thought of him. When those people left, Yunus came out from behind the curtain. The Imam said, "`أَو يونس! آ جاؤ باہر۔` (Oh Yunus! Come out.)" He came out, crying loudly. The Imam said, "Why? Why are you crying?" He said, "I love you so much. I sacrifice so much for you. And these people came and spoke so much ill of me. And you didn't stop them, you didn't say anything." The Imam said, "[Yunus],"—meaning, the essence of the narration is, "I wanted you to hear what they think of you. You should know what they think of you." And then the Imam said a sentence: "[Yunus] what do you care? What does it matter what anyone says? If your Imam is pleased with you." `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) As long as I am pleased, what difference does it make? "Yes, but [Yunus], whenever you talk to people, discuss things, talk according to their level. See how much capacity they have to endure. Don't tell everything to everyone." Why? Because the Master is saying this hadith:

`النَّاسُ أَعْدَاءُ مَا جَهِلُوا.`
People are enemies of what they are ignorant of.
- [Reference needed]

So, if you say things that they cannot digest, they will become your enemies. "What kind of things are these people saying? We have never heard this before." Many people, when we read something, they come and say, "We have never heard this before." It seems like they have read all the books, right?

So, this is the station, this is the position of being a Shia. It requires great sacrifice. It requires killing one's ego. One has to slaughter one's ego. One has to kill one's desires. For example, if we like something to eat, but because that thing is `najis` (ritually impure), we will not eat it. For example, if women, mothers, and sisters do not like `hijab` (Islamic veil). But because it is obligatory in Islam. And because Sayyida Fatima Zahra, peace be upon her, liked it. Because Sayyida Zainab, peace be upon her, liked this, therefore I will wear `hijab`. This is called sacrifice. `Subhanallah!` (Glory be to Allah!) This is called zeal, the zeal for religion. "I don't like `hijab`, it feels like a big burden to me. But because Allah has commanded it as obligatory. Because Sayyida Zahra, peace be upon her, liked it. Because Sayyida Zainab, peace be upon her, liked it, therefore I wear `hijab`." This is called sacrifice. The one who makes such a sacrifice reaches this station.

### The Ultimate Sacrifice: Lessons from Karbala

And just such a sacrifice, you see, the example of sacrifice before us cannot be greater than what we witnessed in the martyrs of Karbala. `Hay, hay!` You see what kind of sacrifice. Every stage, every step, reflect on the immense sacrifices.

#### Imam Hussain's (a.s.) Steadfastness and Luminous Face

The narrations of the martyrdom state a sentence, a very strange sentence: From the morning of Ashura, until the afternoon of Ashura, Sayyid al-Shuhada, [Imam] Hussain, peace be upon him, continuously carried corpses. This is not an easy task. If a person has one or two deaths in their family, they break down. And imagine the state of someone whose family deaths number 18. Just imagine that state. But the sentence in the martyrdom narrations is that as the calamity of Sayyid al-Shuhada, peace be upon him, increased, the light on his face also increased. The light on his face kept increasing.

#### The Final Farewell to the Women of the Tents

Then came that moment when Sayyid al-Shuhada, peace be upon him, came and called out:

"يَا زَيْنَبُ يَا أُمَّ كُلْثُومْ، يَا فِضَّةُ يَا رُقَيَّةُ عَلَيْكُنَّ مِنِّي السَّلَامُ."
O Zainab, O Umm Kulthoom, O Fiddah, O Ruqayya! My final greetings be upon you all.
- [Reference needed]

This final greeting was heard, and in the `Khiyam` (tents), a great uproar broke out. The ladies began to beat their heads. `Wa wayla! Wa tha boora!` (Oh woe! Oh destruction!) Cries were raised. The ladies were weeping. Zainab, peace be upon her, came to the tent door and said, "Brother, what kind of final greeting is this?" He said, "Zainab, no one is left now. There is no helper or supporter left, so how can I—my final moments are now; how can I live?" Zainab, peace be upon her, said, "Brother, if no one else, Zainab is here!"

#### Imam Hussain's (a.s.) Counsel to Imam Zain al-Abidin (a.s.)

Then he said, "Then Zainab, take me to Sayyid al-Sajjad," (Imam Zain al-Abidin, peace be upon him). So Zainab, peace be upon her, took him to Sayyid al-Sajjad. She said, "My son, Sayyid al-Sajjad, get up, see, father has come. See, father has come." Imam Zain al-Abidin, peace be upon him, opened his eyes. He was so ill that when he saw [Imam] Hussain, peace be upon him, he could not recognize him. The Imam was so wounded and covered in blood that he could not be recognized. He said, "Aunt, where is father? Where is father?" [Imam] Hussain, peace be upon him, embraced him and said, "My son, Sayyid al-Sajjad, how will you recognize me now? This is my condition." He said, "Father, is this your condition?" Sayyid al-Sajjad, peace be upon him, asked about each one, "Where did they go?" He replied, `قَدْ قُتِلَ.` (Qad qutil - He has been killed.)" Until Sayyid al-Sajjad, peace be upon him, asked:

`أَيْنَ أَيْنَ عَلِيُّ أَكْبَرُ؟`
Where, oh where is Ali Akbar?
- [Reference needed]

He said, `قَدْ قُتِلَ.` (He has been killed.)" Then finally, he asked:

`أَيْنَ أَيْنَ عَمِّيَ الْعَبَّاسُ؟`
Where, oh where is my uncle Abbas?
- [Reference needed]

Why did Zain al-Abidin, peace be upon him, ask? Because how could this be your condition while Uncle Abbas was present? [Imam] Hussain, peace be upon him, replied, "`قَدْ قُتِلَ.` (He has been killed.)" "Oh! Abbas too has been killed!" As soon as he heard this, Zain al-Abidin, peace be upon him, said, "Aunt, bring me my sword! I will defend my father!" [Imam] Hussain, peace be upon him, said, "No, my son, this is not the place for your `Jihad` (struggle). This is not the place for your `Jihad`. The places for your `Jihad` will be the bazaars of Kufa and Shaam."

"When you see your mothers and sisters unveiled, my son, bear patience in that state. When you see your mothers and sisters in that condition, when whips are lashed upon the backs of your mothers and sisters, when your young sister Sakina is slapped, my son, be patient. That will be the time for patience. At that time, be patient."

"And my son, when you go to Medina, convey my greetings to my Shia and tell them:"

"شِيعَتِي مَا إِنْ شَرِبْتُمْ مَاءً عَذْبًا فَاذْكُرُونِي."
O my Shia, whenever you drink sweet water, remember my thirst.
- [Reference needed]

"And whenever you see a helpless and oppressed person, remember my helplessness and my oppression." `Wa Hussayna! Wa Mazluma!` (Oh Hussain! Oh oppressed one!) `Hay!`
