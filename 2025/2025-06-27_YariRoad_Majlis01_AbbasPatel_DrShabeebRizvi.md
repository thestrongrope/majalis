## Content

Our Master and Lord, Husayn ibn Ali (peace be upon them both) said:

**ولوصبرتم على الأذى وتحملتم مؤونة في ذات الله كانت أمور الله عليكم ترد وعنكم تصدر وإليكم ترجع**
(And if you had been patient upon adversity and borne the burden for the sake of Allah, the affairs of Allah would have come to you, proceeded from you, and returned to you.)
- [Reference needed]

Our Master, Husayn ibn Ali (peace be upon them both) has spoken truthfully.

### The Core Teaching: Imam Husayn's Hadith

The noble hadith whose recitation we have been honored with, and which was chosen for these five Husayni gatherings, is a hadith from Tuhaf al-Uqul (A book of sayings/wisdoms). Shaikh Hullani, may Allah be pleased with him, was a very great traditionist of the 9th Hijri century. He wrote the book Tuhaf al-Uqul. In it, he narrated this hadith from Sayyid al-Shuhada, and he states that Sayyid al-Shuhada explained it so much that:

**ولوصبرتم على الأذى**
(And if you had been patient upon adversity)
- [Reference needed]

– if you had been patient with afflictions –

**وتحملتم المؤونة في ذات الله**
(And borne the burden for the sake of Allah)
- [Reference needed]

And for the sake of Allah, if you had borne and endured difficulties, tolerated them, endured them, then

**كانت أمور الله عليكم ترد**
(the affairs of Allah would have come to you)
- [Reference needed]

Then the affairs of Allah would have come upon you, meaning, descended upon you. And

**وعنكم تصدر**
(and proceed from you)
- [Reference needed]

– and the affairs of Allah would have proceeded from you.

**وإليكم ترجع**
(and returned to you)
- [Reference needed]

And all those affairs, all the affairs of Allah, would return to you. This means that Allah's special attention would be upon you if these two things were found in you. Which two things? It's very important. One: patience on adversity – if you were patient with afflictions – and for the sake of Allah, you endured difficulties. These two things.

### Diverse Forms of Patience (Sabr)

So look, you must have heard a lot about patience (sabr). Patience and adversity (**صبرت والاذى**). Different types of patience have been mentioned in narrations; there are many hadiths. At least more than five hundred hadiths on the topic of patience have been narrated here, at the minimum. At least five hundred hadiths, no less than that. So many hadiths, and on different aspects of patience.

#### Patience During Calamities

For example, being patient during calamities is one thing, meaning, patience on obligatory acts is another thing, and patience in the face of forbidden things is a third thing, meaning, what Allah has forbidden. You know what it means to be patient during calamities; it means that when a person faces a calamity, they should be patient, because this calamity has come from Allah. After all, Allah saw goodness in it for that person, which is why Allah sent this calamity upon them. No matter how big the calamity is, that's not the issue. No matter how big the calamity is, that's not the issue. It's just that one should be patient with it.

#### Patience with Obligatory Acts (Fara'idh)

Secondly, regarding obligatory acts, what does patience on obligatory acts mean? It means what Allah has made obligatory. For example, Fajr prayer is obligatory. Now, for young people, waking up for Fajr prayer in the morning is a very difficult task, even for very old people. For people like us who have reached a certain level of seriousness and self-awareness, it's a different matter, because their brains have less water. Less water, right? Like, as age increases, or like when a child is born, the water in their brain, its quantity is very high, which is why they sleep very well. That's why the English idiom "sleep like a baby" is used, right? That's why they say that. So you can see, when a child sleeps, they are completely, that is, they sleep completely oblivious, right? Similarly, that's why the idiom is used. But as a person's age increases, the water in the brain decreases, and accordingly, their sleep decreases, and they sleep less. That's why you see older people, those who have aged (God willing, they will tell you), look at your own example: we, if we sleep at 2 AM, our eyes open at 4:30 or 5 AM. But it's not like that with young people. For young people, it's like, if they sleep, they might stay awake all night; their capacity to stay awake is tremendous. But if they sleep, then it's very difficult to wake them up. So it's a struggle (jihad) when they wake up in the morning. Meaning, even if they sleep late at night or sleep however, what is the struggle for them? That if the prayer time is 4:50 in the morning, they should wake up for the prayer. This is patience, meaning, what is he being patient with? He is sacrificing his sleep. Meaning, he is patient with this sleep, with its reduction; he gets up, performs ablution, goes and prays, and then can come back and sleep. That's not an issue. Even if he comes back and sleeps then. But at least he wakes up at prayer time. This is called patience: "**الصبر على الفريضة**" (Patience on the obligatory act), meaning, obligations, or "**الصبر على الفرائض**" (Patience on the obligations), meaning, patience on obligations. Or, for example, when you fast, especially in the summer season, it's very difficult to fast, but still, we fast, enduring difficulties. Similarly, when people go for Hajj, they endure difficulties from all over the world. That is, the biggest difficulty is enduring these Saudis. They themselves are a great calamity. But anyway, a person endures. And goes, sees them, sees their faces, and still performs Hajj. They go, perform Umrah. This means patience on obligatory acts.

#### Patience in Avoiding Forbidden Things (Muharramat)

And what is patience on forbidden things called? For example, if something forbidden comes up, one should be patient with it, although it's a very difficult task, and that's why the Imams themselves have said, that is, in Usul Kafi, I mean in Volume 2 of Usul Kafi, there's a chapter: "**باب اجتناب المحارم**" (Chapter on avoiding forbidden things), meaning, one about staying away from forbidden things, meaning, a chapter. This chapter is about what? It's about choosing to stay away from forbidden things. So in it, they bring a chapter; Shaikh Kulayni narrates a hadith that "**من أشد**" (Of the most difficult), "**اشد**" (most difficult) – the Imam is using this word, Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him). The most difficult thing Allah has made obligatory upon His servants, "**من أشد ما فرض الله**" (Of the most difficult things Allah has made obligatory), "**ما افترض الله على العباد**" (What Allah has made obligatory upon His servants) – what is the most difficult thing Allah has made obligatory? It is abstinence from forbidden things. Meaning, sorry, the hadith's connection is like this: "**من أشد مما افترض الله على العباد ذکر اللہ کثیرا**" (Of the most difficult of what Allah has made obligatory upon His servants is the abundant remembrance of Allah).
- [Reference needed]

The words of the hadith are these: that to remember Allah abundantly is the most difficult task. The Imam says, these are the Imam's words, not ours. "**ذکر اللہ کثیرا**" (Abundant remembrance of Allah).
- [Reference needed]

And immediately after that, the Imam clarifies, meaning, the sentence is declarative, it is explanatory. The Imam immediately clarifies, "**لا أعني**" (I do not mean), **سبحان اللہ والحمد للہ ولا الہ الا اللہ واللہ اکبر** (Glory be to Allah, and praise be to Allah, and there is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest). By this, the Imam's intention is not that a person should say "Glory be to Allah" and sit and remember Allah, "**سبحان اللہ والحمد للہ ولا الہ الا اللہ واللہ اکبر**" (Glory be to Allah, and praise be to Allah, and there is no god but Allah, and Allah is the Greatest). For example, if we sit with a rosary and say this is the most difficult remembrance. No, anyone can do this. Anyone can do this. The Imam says that my intention is that the most difficult thing, the most difficult task, is when something forbidden comes before a person, when something forbidden comes, and they control themselves. That is the most difficult task. Why? There's a reason. Look, ponder it. The Imams explain such psychology, because, really, it is difficult. It is very difficult. The Imam says, why? What is its reason? The Imam says it's the most difficult task. Why? What is the reason? Because what is the main existence of a human? It is the self (nafs). It is the human self. A person's being has three parts: a self (nafs), a soul (ruh), a body (badan). A person is made of these three things: self, soul, body. According to hadiths, yes. Philosophers did not understand the self; philosophers do not even believe in the self because it never occurred to them what the self is, but the Imams have talked about it. So obviously, we follow the Imams, not the philosophers.

### The Dangerous Nature of the Self (Nafs)

So the self that Allah has created for a human, this self is a very dangerous thing. This is a verse from the Quran, not our words. In the Quran, Allah Almighty says that:

**إن النفس لأمارة بالسوء**
(Indeed, the soul [self] is ever inclined to evil)
- [Quran 12:53]

What is this self? It is "**امارة**" (Ammarah - greatly commanding/inclined). Meaning, it commands a lot, it orders a lot. Do this, do this, do this, do this, very much. Towards what? Goodness? No. "**بالسوء**" (towards evil),

**إلا ما رحم ربي**
(except for that which my Lord has mercy upon).
- [Quran 12:53]

Only those upon whom the Lord sends mercy can be saved. And the way to save oneself, that has also been mentioned in narrations, in hadith. The Imam says that the example the Imam gave is this: "**إن النفس**" (Indeed, the self) – what is the example of the self?

**مثل أخبث الدواب**
(like the most vicious of beasts).
- [Reference needed]

**إن لم تقيد حارت**
(If it is not tied down, it will wander madly).
- [Reference needed]

What is the example of the self? That it is like an animal that is out of control, an unruly animal. You must have seen, right? This horse, which is completely wild and mad, no one can ride it. This self is that. This self is that horse, that animal. The Imam says, these are the Imam's words: "**إن النفس**" (Indeed, the self) – what is the self? "**مثل أخبث الدواب**" (like the most vicious of beasts). What is its example? The most vile animal. Here, by 'vile', it means one that is out of control. It is not in control. So what is necessary for it? The Imam says, "**إن لم تقيد حارت**" (If it is not tied down, it will wander madly). If it is not tied down, it will wander like a mad person. Look what example the Imam gave. If it is not tied down, it will wander like a mad person. With what should it be tied? With intellect. Allah has given intellect to humans for this very reason, so that through this intellect, they may tie down this animal, to keep this animal in control. Because it constantly keeps commanding: commit sin, commit sin, commit sin. It's very difficult, which is why perhaps you might have heard in narrations, this hadith is very famous among us: that Allah has not placed desires in angels. He has not placed desires. And He has only given them intellect, that's it. And in animals, Allah has only placed desires, He has not given intellect. And in humans, Allah has given both desires and intellect. If a human gains control over their desires, then they are superior to angels. They are superior to angels. And if they do not gain control over their self, then they are worse than animals. They are worse than animals.

### Allah's Tests and Human Limitations

So see what happens in this; there are many people. "Holier than thou", you understand, it's an English saying. Meaning, there is no one holier than me. There was a Muqaddas Ardabili; he passed away four hundred years ago, and after that, whoever was born, it's me. You understood, right? You will try to become very holy. See, this is what happens: that Allah takes severe tests of His servants. He takes them up, and then takes such a test that the servant, by Allah, their condition becomes dire. And this is also a sentence from a hadith. The Imam says, this is also narrated in Tuhaf al-Uqul, that Allah takes one higher and higher, and the higher He takes them, the more severe their test becomes. After that, the Imam says that after reaching the very top, either a person falls down, or goes even higher. And then, after that, the Imam states a sentence from a hadith, that the Imam says, "**إما أسفل وإما يرفع وإما يسفل**" (Either he goes lower, or he is raised, or he falls), meaning, he will become prey to the wind, of carnal desires. So then, the Imam says, "**وأكثرهم يسفل**" (But most of them fall).
- [Reference needed]

But the majority, meaning ninety-nine percent or ninety-nine point nine nine percent, fall down. If the Imam says majority, it means ninety-nine point nine nine percent. Allah takes him higher and higher; after that, He keeps taking tests at every stage, at every stage, except for the Infallibles (peace be upon them), that's it. The Infallibles (peace be upon them) are those beings. That's why a hadith, a very famous hadith, is also present in Kafi: that some companions were sitting with the Messenger of Allah. The Messenger of Allah gave them some reminders, admonitions, like we have reminders in gatherings. The companions were very affected. They were very affected by it, very much affected by the admonition. They said, "O Messenger of Allah, when we sit with you, we are so affected by your words that we feel this world is all useless, and there is nothing in the world, and so on, all such things. But as soon as we get up from there and go out, and then get involved in worldly affairs, with our wives and children, and then all those same things happen again, we get involved, and then something, that is, here and there, their meaning was that some forbidden things, some this, some that, all happens." The Prophet did not say that if we were in the Prophet's place—that's why Allah has not kept it—"**استغفراللہ ربي وأتوب إليك**" (I seek forgiveness from my Lord and turn to Him), no, no, no, brother. But what does the Prophet say? Listen, what a strange sentence, yes! What are these people saying? Look, what are they saying? That when we get up and leave, we get involved in worldly affairs again and then become victims of sins, we become victims of forbidden things. The Prophet says that this is a natural thing. This is a natural thing. That when you leave from here and then get busy in this world, if you were in the same state outside as you are when you are with me here, then "**لصافحتکم الملائکہ**" (the angels would shake hands with you) and "**ومشيتم على الماء**" (and you would walk on water).
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, you would be prophets, then you would not be non-infallible. You would become infallible. But the Prophet says this is natural. And then after that, there is a strange sentence in a hadith, it's in Kafi, I'm not speaking from myself. The Prophet says that if people were not such sinners, Allah would create some people – these are the hadith's sentences; if anyone can digest this, fine; if not, no problem, it's their problem. The Prophet says that He would create such individuals who would commit sins, and after committing sins, they would seek repentance and forgiveness from Allah, and Allah would accept their repentance and forgive them so that He could manifest His name 'Ya Ghafoor' (O Forgiver). Allah would set them free so that when they cry, plead, and ask for forgiveness, "**استغفراللہ ربي وأتوب إليك**" (I seek forgiveness from my Lord and turn to Him), then Allah would forgive him and tell [him]. That's why there's a couplet in Urdu, I don't know if it's correct or incorrect, that we've been hearing since childhood. We've been hearing the couplet since childhood. Now, I don't know if the couplet is correct or incorrect; we don't know, yes. This couplet, because it's not about the people of Hadith or the poets, I'll just recite it, whether it's correct or incorrect. As for poets, the Quran has already decided about them, but that's a separate matter. So the couplet is that in the Day of Judgment, they will ask, what is it?

یوم محشر یہ پوچھیں گے نیکوکار سے فرشتے، گنہ کیا نہیں تھا کیا، خدا رحیم نہیں تھا کیا؟
(In the Day of Judgment, angels will ask the pious: "Did you not sin? Was Allah not Merciful?")
- [Reference needed]

It's clear, isn't it? In the Day of Judgment, the angels will ask the pious ones – the pious are very devout and abstinent: "Why didn't you sin? Was Allah not Merciful?" So in this hadith, the Prophet says that even if you did not commit sins, by Allah, He would create a nation that would commit sins, and after that, they would repent so that Allah could forgive them. So these three types, I presented to you, these are the three types of patience.

### Endurance (Tahammul) for the Sake of Allah

After that, Sayyid al-Shuhada says, "**وتحملتم المؤنة في ذات الله**" (And you bear the burden for the sake of Allah), and you endure things for the sake of Allah. It's very important. Enduring things for the sake of Allah, one should endure things in the way of Allah. Look, there is a word in the Quran: **شرح صدر** (Sharh Sadr - expansion of the breast/heart). You must have heard **شرح صدر** (Sharh Sadr). Those who are a bit religious, devout, they hear these words: have **شرح صدر** (Sharh Sadr). **شرح صدر** (Sharh Sadr) means having a broad heart. Having a broad heart. These words have appeared three or four times in the Quran, at least.

#### Prophet Musa's Prayer for Sharh Sadr

One was the prayer of Prophet Musa, if you recall, that Prophet Musa prayed to Allah:

**رب اشرح لي صدري ويسر لي أمري واحلل عقدة من لساني يفقهوا قولي**
(My Lord, expand for me my breast and ease for me my affair, and untie the knot from my tongue so that they may understand my speech.)
- [Quran 20:25-28]

"O Lord, make my heart broad." This meaning has come at least four times, **شرح صدر** (Sharh Sadr), at least. "**رب اشرح لي صدري**" (My Lord, expand for me my breast), "**ويسر لي أمري**" (and ease for me my affair), "**واحلل عقدة من لساني يفقهوا قولي**" (And untie the knot from my tongue so that they may understand my speech). And the knot in my tongue – like how Prophet Musa's tongue was burned in childhood, due to that, he had a slight lisp. He had a slight lisp in his tongue. So that's why they say, "**واحلل عقدة من لساني يفقهوا قولي**" (And untie the knot from my tongue so that they may understand my speech), so that these people understand what I am saying. And then, I mean, sorry, there are verses: "**وشدد به ازری**" (And strengthen my back with him), and, meaning, strengthen my back through my brother Harun. Prophet Musa prayed. Allah further said, "We have accepted your prayer." Allah accepted the prayer. Prophet Musa's prayer was accepted. So what was Prophet Musa's prayer? To expand the heart.

#### Prophet Muhammad's Innate Sharh Sadr

Now, this expansion of the heart, two types of it have been mentioned. But before explaining those two types, we are talking about two prophets for you. One prophet is he who is praying to Allah: "**رب اشرح لي صدري ويسر لي أمري**" (My Lord, expand for me my breast and ease for me my affair). "O Lord, make my heart broad." And another prophet is the Seal of Prophets and Messengers, the Beloved of the worlds, the Beloved of the Lord of the worlds, Muhammad Mustafa, may Allah bless him. That addressing him, Allah says:

**ألم نشرح لك صدرك**
(Did We not expand for you your breast?)
- [Quran 94:1]

"Did We not already expand your heart? We have expanded your heart, meaning, you don't even need to pray; We have already done it." "**ألم نشرح لك صدرك**" (Did We not expand for you your breast?). "We made your heart very broad." Allah had already made the heart of the Messenger of Allah very, very broad. The Messenger of Allah endured a lot, endured a lot for the sake of Allah. Look, this Surah is so important that Allah, meaning, it's not Surah An-Naziat; the name of this Surah itself became **انشراح** (Inshirah - The Opening Forth). The name of the Surah itself is **انشراح** (Inshirah). Meaning, that Surah in which **شرح صدر** (Sharh Sadr) was talked about. Now, what is this discussion of two types of **شرح صدر** (Sharh Sadr)? It's about the heart becoming broad. One prophet is praying, and for the other prophet, Allah is saying, "Did We not make your heart broad? We have already made your heart broad."

#### Sharh Sadr for Ordinary People

Now let's talk about ordinary people. Now, when we talk about ordinary, ordinary, ordinary people, what do you see? In the Quran, too, two kinds of people are mentioned, who are ordinary people. One type is about whom the Quran says – this is Surah An'am, verse number 125:

**فمن یرد اللہ أن یہدیہ یشرح صدرہ للاسلام**
(So whoever Allah intends to guide, He expands his breast to Islam).
- [Quran 6:125]

One, meaning, for whom Allah intends to guide them, Allah decides to guide them. So what does Allah do for them? He expands their heart in the way of Islam. He makes it broad in the way of Islam. They endure many things. They are not impatient. Their heart is not constricted. They do not get upset quickly upon seeing difficulties. They endure the afflictions from their believing brethren. They are not impatient with their afflictions, meaning, and do not quarrel with them. No. This is the habit of those whose hearts Allah has made constricted. This is a verse from Surah An'am. "**فمن یشرح صدرہ ومن یرد اللہ أن یہدیہ**" (So whoever expands his breast, and whoever Allah intends to guide) – Allah wants to guide whom? What does He do? "**یشرح صدرہ**" (He expands his breast), but for what? "**للاسلام**" (for Islam). He makes it broad for Islam. Because the heart can also be broad for disbelief. Meaning, it is also mentioned in the Quran. In the Quran, there is mention of those whose hearts are broad for disbelief, for disobedience to Allah. For example, we see when we go out on the road, by Allah, we see that Allah's disobedience is happening. People are disobeying Allah, meaning, they are not listening to Allah, not obeying Him. There is polytheism, disbelief, sin all around. But it doesn't affect our well-being. We don't feel bad that this person is disobeying Allah; it doesn't make any difference to us. And especially if there is some benefit for us in it, then there's no question at all. Meaning, we might even encourage them a bit, saying, "Mashallah, you are doing a very good job!" It's clear, isn't it? Whose sign is this? The Quran says this is a sign of those from whom Allah has withdrawn His help, has abandoned them. He has left them to their own devices, finished. Meaning, they are ruined. Meaning, these are those about whom it is found in hadith that Allah says, "I don't care in which valley they perish. I don't care whatever their condition is, I have no problem." So to tolerate this, to endure this, is a very difficult task.

So one is patience (sabr) and the other is endurance (tahammul). This is it, right? What is the difference between sabr and tahammul? There is a difference between sabr and tahammul. Tahammul means to endure, and people also say sabr means to endure, right? But in sabr and hilm and tahammul, meaning, hilm and tahammul, both are derivations, meaning, in Arabic, they say 'ishtiqaaq' means both have the same meaning, okay? To endure. So in both of these, the difference is that sabr is something in which we are involved alone, individually. Meaning, if a calamity strikes, it strikes us. If we have to perform obligatory acts, we have to do it. If we have to refrain from forbidden things, we have to do it. All this is sabr. But hilm is that, endurance is called that in which a person has a connection with the person in front, with someone else, meaning, they have a link: that they have to endure the behavior of the person in front. They have to endure it, them. Therefore, they endure. So these are two things that are very important.

### The Divine Outcomes of Sabr and Tahammul

Sayyid al-Shuhada says if these two things are found in you, then what happens? What is the result? The same as the Prophet said. Here Sayyid al-Shuhada says that if that were the case, "**كانت أمور الله عليكم ترد**" (the affairs of Allah would have come to you).
- [Reference needed]

The affairs of Allah would have come upon you. Meaning, Allah's light would come to you. Angels would inspire you. Your stage would be different. As is found in narrations, in hadith, you know, right? That beware of the discernment of a believer, because they see with the light of Allah.

**اتقوا فراسة المؤمن فإنه ينظر بنور الله**
(Beware of the discernment of a believer, for indeed he sees with the light of Allah).
- [Reference needed]

He sees with the light of Allah. A believer sees with the light of Allah. Angels inspire them. It is narrated in Kafi that no person can be a jurist (faqih) until they are a **محدث** (Muhaddith - one who is spoken to by angels). **محدث** (Muhaddith), what does **محدث** (Muhaddith) mean? It means one with whom angels speak. The one with whom angels converse, that is called **محدث** (Muhaddith). So the Imam says that until then, a believer... Until then, a human cannot be a jurist (faqih) – faqih meaning a scholar – until angels speak to them. The narrator heard it and could not digest it. He could not digest it, so he asked, "O Messenger of Allah, do angels also converse with ordinary humans?" The answer was "**محدث**" (Muhaddith). Meaning, angels, it means that Allah explains the concepts to him through angels. He tells him things. And if a jurist understands things, it is only because Allah explains it through angels, that's why they understand things. If Allah does not explain, they will not understand. It will not be possible for them to understand. Therefore, he says that the affairs of Allah will come upon you, meaning, Allah's mercy will descend upon you. Allah's special attention will be upon you.

**وعنكم تصدر**
(and proceed from you).
- [Reference needed]

And the affairs of Allah will proceed from you. Meaning, such words will come from your tongue that Allah likes. You will make such decisions that Allah likes. The condition is that you go close to Allah, be near Allah, perform such deeds that you become close to Allah and come near to Allah. This is the condition. This is the condition: that you are close to Allah.

**عنكم تصدر وإليكم ترجع**
(and proceed from you and return to you).
- [Reference needed]

And all these affairs will return to you. Allah will return all affairs to you. Meaning, Allah, many things, both in this world and in the afterlife, Allah will bestow upon you many of His blessings, miracles, and mercies. He will grant you such things that the people of the world cannot even imagine.

That's why you see that the great jurists (fuqaha) among us, both now and in the past, in the past and even now, such jurists exist. You go and see. If you go to Najaf or Qom, some people are familiar with them; we see them: that they have reached that stage, that they have a strange and extraordinary level. Meaning, they don't care about worldly fame, nor about worldly recognition: who meets them, who doesn't meet them, who comes, who doesn't come, no one (cares). They just keep doing their work, training students, writing books, and are at a strange level, a strange stage, meaning, truly amazing. Meaning, by looking at them, one realizes they don't care about the world even an iota. Not an iota of care. Meaning, there is a very great scholar. In Najaf al-Ashraf, often, when we go, we try to meet him. We meet them and benefit a little from them. They are very great, Mashallah, meaning, very great in knowledge and virtue. His young son passed away. He was barely thirty years old. Barely thirty years old. And he died in an accident. He passed away. His body came. The child was buried. Ayatollah Sayyid Hakim led his funeral prayer. His father was standing beside him. Look, it is a very difficult stage for a father to attend the funeral of his young son. This is not an easy thing. This is not an easy thing; it's very easy to say, very easy to hear. But ask the father who goes through it: what is it in the words of Mir Anis: "Ask the one with children about the grief of losing children." Ask the one whose son has died. So we ourselves saw the video that Ayatollah Sayyid Hakim was standing beside his son's coffin. And the funeral prayer was being offered. After that, when it was over, the burial took place in the evening. And the next day morning, he was sitting for his lesson, teaching. It's not that he wasn't affected. He was affected. He was very affected. Because when we went to meet him, his condition was very distraught. It's about a young son. He was also very intelligent, we know he was very brilliant. He was very brilliant. He was very sharp in studies. Meaning, understand that he was about thirty years old, but understand that he had almost reached the stage of Ijtihad. Mashallah, very excellent. In studies. But whatever it is, he was in his lesson the next morning. As if nothing had happened. Meaning, it seemed so to people, but it did happen, yet no one knows what a father's heart goes through, anyway.

### The Ummah's Deviation and the Tragedy of Karbala

So Sayyid al-Shuhada says this in the same hadith; this hadith is very lengthy: that Sayyid al-Shuhada says that the expectation from you is all this. But what actually happened? Something else happened. And, meaning, you know that when the Messenger of Allah closed his eyes here, the Ummah abandoned the Ahl al-Bayt. Saqifa (**ثقیفہ**) happened. And what people did, they did. Fire was set to the door of Lady Zahra's house. A rope was put around the blessed neck of Amir al-Mu'minin (peace be upon him). Arrows were showered on the funeral of Imam Hasan al-Mujtaba (peace be upon him); he was poisoned. Until the stage reached that Karbala came. When Karbala came, then this was the stage of Karbala that Imam Husayn (peace be upon him) was standing alone and calling out:

**هل من ناصر ينصرنا هل من ذاب يذب عن حرم رسول الله**
(Is there any helper who would help us? Is there any defender who would defend the family of the Messenger of Allah?)
- [Reference needed]

The scholar-poet says that Husayn said, "O Lord, for Your sake, I have given my entire self, my life, my family. I have orphaned my children, O Lord, and for Your sake, I am also prepared for my body to be torn into pieces." Imam Reza (peace be upon him) says:

**یا ابن شبیب ان کنت باک فبک لجد الحسین**
(O son of Shabib, if you weep, then weep for my grandfather Husayn).
- [Reference needed]

"O son of Shabib, if you ever feel like weeping, then weep for my grandfather Husayn. Weep for Husayn,

**فانه ذبح كما يذبح الكبش**
(for indeed he was slaughtered as a ram is slaughtered).
- [Reference needed]

Because he was slaughtered in the same way a sheep is slaughtered. In this way, my grandfather Husayn and eighteen young men from Bani Hashim with him were killed. Their example is not found in the universe.

**لقد بكت السماوات السبع والأرضون لقتله**
(Indeed, the seven heavens and the earths wept for his killing).
- [Reference needed]

The seven heavens and the earth weep for Husayn's killing. That's why when Dibel Khuza'i presented himself before Imam Reza and in the service of Imam Reza (peace be upon him), during the days of mourning, Dibel says that I presented myself before Imam Reza. I said, "The Imam ordered me, Dibel, "**ارس لللحسين**" (Recite for Husayn)." "Recite an elegy for Husayn." So that Dibel began reciting the elegy:

**افاطمة لو خلت الحسين مجدلا**
(O Fatima, if you were to see Husayn sprawled)
- [Reference needed]

– "O Fatima, behold Husayn's corpse lying in Karbala –

**ومَاتَ عَطْشَانَ بِشَطِّ الْفُرَاتِ**
(And he died thirsty by the bank of the Euphrates)
- [Reference needed]

– "He is lying thirsty on the bank of the Euphrates."

**اذا لطمت الخدين فاطم عنده**
(Then Fatima would slap her cheeks by him)
- [Reference needed]

– "O Fatima, look at Husayn's condition, then you would mourn by slapping your cheeks; you would make a scene of loss on your cheeks."

**واجر يتدم العين في الخدين**
(And shed tears of blood on her cheeks).
- [Reference needed]

"And you would weep profusely." Dibel was reciting the elegy when the women heard it and started crying out loud. They fainted. I will say, O people of the household, you heard the elegy from Dibel's mouth, and you could not bear it! Oh, come! On the afternoon of Ashura, Lady Zaynab (peace be upon her) is standing and calling out: "O son of Sa'd, you are seeing my elder brother being killed?"

**وسيعلم الذین ظلموا ائم منقلب ینقلبون**
(And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned.)
- [Quran 26:227]

**لَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ**
(The curse of Allah be upon the wrongdoing people.)
- [Reference needed]

O Lord, Imam of the Time.
