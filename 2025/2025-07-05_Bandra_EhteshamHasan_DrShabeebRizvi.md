As for what follows, our master and chief, Imam al-Sadiq (peace be upon him), said:

### Introduction: The Value of Grief for Ahl al-Bayt

#### Imam al-Sadiq's Hadith on Sorrow and Worship

He said:
نفس المهموم لنا تسبيح وهمه لنا عبادة.
"The breath of one grieved for us is glorification, and his sorrow for us is worship."
- [Reference needed]

Then he said:
يجب ان يكتب هذا الحديث بالذهب.
"This hadith should be written in gold."
- [Reference needed]

Our master, Imam al-Sadiq (peace be upon him), spoke the truth. The Imam states in this hadith: "Nafs al-Mahmum (نفس المهموم)", which means "The breath of the grieved one." *Nafs* (نفس), you know, means breath, breathing, and *mahmum* (مهموم) means one who is in sorrow and grief, who is sad. One who is sorrowful is called *mahmum* (مهموم) in Arabic. So, *Nafs al-Mahmum* (نفس المهموم), one who is in sorrow and grief, who is fully distressed, grieved for us, is taking cool breaths; remembering our oppression, every single breath of his will be *tasbih* (تسبیح) (glorification of Allah). Its reward is the reward of *tasbih* (تسبیح). Our oppression will be *tasbih* (تسبیح).

And his sorrow for us is worship (*wa hammuhu lana ibadah* – وهمه لنا عبادة). And one who is afflicted with sorrow and grief for us, when we are sad, he becomes sad; this is worship. After this, the Imam states that it is *wajib* (واجب) (obligatory), that this hadith should be written in golden words, written in gold. This hadith should be written with gold ink. The Imam says, it is *wajib* (واجب). *Yajibu* (يجب), it is *wajib* (واجب) that it be written.

### The Distinguishing Mark of a Shia

Look, to be sad in the sorrow of the Ahl al-Bayt (اهل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them) and to be happy in their happiness, this is a sign of a Shia. This is a sign, and you can easily let me first present the hadith to you, and then you will see what you will see practically is clear, it does not require much detailed explanation.

#### Imam al-Mahdi's Hadith on Joy and Sorrow

The hadith is very famous. The Twelfth Imam, Imam al-Mahdi (may our souls be sacrificed for him), as narrated by Sayyid ibn Tawus, a very great scholar of the seventh century. He narrated this hadith, saying that when he was descending into the *sardab* (سرداب) (cellar)—you know the *sardab* (سرداب) in Samarra, right? That *sardab* (سرداب), which is the cellar, from where Imam al-Mahdi disappeared, that is called *sardab* (سرداب). Many people say that Imam al-Mahdi does not live there. And many people say that Imam al-Mahdi – many Shias say that Imam al-Mahdi lives there, he emerged from there – all this is wrong; it is their slander. The Imam disappeared from there; it was a part of the house. It was part of the Eleventh Imam's house. Just like in olden times, even today in UP, you will see there is a basement downstairs. That's because in hot regions, back when there was no AC, people used to build basements because the basement would stay cool.

So it is called *sardab* (سرداب) in Arabic. So that *sardab* (سرداب), in that *sardab* (سرداب), when Sayyid ibn Tawus descends into it—even today, when people go for *ziyarat* (زیارت) (pilgrimage), they go there, right?—so when Sayyid ibn Tawus descends into the *sardab* (سرداب), he met Imam al-Mahdi. He performed *ziyarat* (زیارت); in fact, he was honored with the *ziyarat* (زیارت). He said that Imam al-Mahdi himself was present in the *sardab* (سرداب) and was praying to Allah, and that hadith is very long; we will only mention one sentence from it. The hadith begins like this: "O Lord,

اللهم انا شیعتنا خلقوا من فاضل طینتنا
O Allah, verily our Shias were created from the surplus of our clay.
- [Reference needed]

O Lord, our Shias were created from our essence, from our clay. They were created from our clay, *fadhil tinatina* (فاضل طینتنا), which was our excess clay; You created them from it. And what is its sign? What is the sign? What is the sign of being a Shia? The Imam says:

یفرحون لفرحنا و یحزنون لحزننا.
They rejoice in our joy and grieve in our sorrow.
- [Reference needed]

When we are happy, they are happy; when we are sad, they are sad. This is a sign of being a Shia. A Shia, no matter how great his own personal joy may be, if it is the days of mourning, he will never celebrate. And no matter how great his personal grief, even if someone in the house has passed away, if it is a period of the Ahl al-Bayt's (اهل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them) joy—for example, Ghadir, 13th of Rajab, or any other occasion, 3rd of Sha'ban, 15th of Sha'ban—then he will prefer the Ahl al-Bayt's (اهل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them) joy over his own sorrow. He will give preference; he won't say, "We are not celebrating 15th Sha'ban this year because so-and-so passed away." This is a sign of fools. Those who have weak belief, whose faith is weak, they talk like this. Otherwise, a true Shia will neither prefer his personal joy nor his grief. The joy of the Ahl al-Bayt (اهل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them) is joy for him; the sorrow of the Ahl al-Bayt (اهل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them) is sorrow for him.

#### The Connection of Shias to Ahl al-Bayt's Essence

And look, what the Imam mentioned, that mention is like this: *khuluqu min fadhil tinatina* (خلقو من فاضل طینتنا) (They were created from the surplus of our clay). Meaning, with what did the Imam mention? To what did he link the Shias? To clay. Clay means creation, right? The creation of a human being is very important. And how is that known? It is known by actions. It's known by actions, otherwise it's not written on anyone's forehead—well, it is written, but no one recognizes it except the Ahl al-Bayt (اهل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them). No one knows what is written on the forehead except the Imams. So how will you recognize it? You will recognize it by his actions. See, that's why it's very important. We have always continuously emphasized this point in the current *majlis* (مجلس) (gathering) that is ongoing, and the ten-day period that is running, and we are still saying the same thing. Our address, especially to the youth, is that you must study history. By the grace of Allah, everything is available nowadays. First Google, now ChatGPT has arrived. Although, don't rely too much on ChatGPT, okay? Because AI is artificial intelligence; it is truly artificial. It's clear, right? A lot of wrong information comes; don't blindly trust it completely. Always cross-check it. Okay? So this is very important. Google is better; search a bit, and you will find out. It is known by a person's actions. Let me give you a small example.

### Historical Lineages: Truth vs. Falsehood

Look, the grief of Karbala that we commemorate. Let's set it aside for a moment in terms of belief. For a minute, leave belief, don't talk about belief. Just check the history. If you check the history, it will immediately become clear to you who is on the side of truth and who is on the side of falsehood.

#### The Pure Lineage of Imam Hussain (Ahl al-Bayt)

Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) is on one side. Who is his father? Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin). No introduction is needed. What service did he render to the religion? Zameer Sitapuri said, "Oh, if he just says one couplet, that's enough." That:
"Help, service, love, affection, sermons, prostrations, swordsmanship, the religion of God is submerged in the favors of Haydar (Commander of the Faithful)."

Oh, what a couplet Zameer Sahib has said! They say, "Help, service, love, affection, sermons, prostrations, swordsmanship, the religion of God is submerged in the favors of Haydar (Commander of the Faithful)." There isn't much time now; we will either elaborate on the entire virtue or just briefly mention this: that Islam is immersed in the favors of the Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon him). There can be no greater statement than this. And if you don't want to stop there, go even further up. His father's title is *Muhsin-e-Islam* (محسن اسلام) (Benefactor of Islam). Abu Talib's title is *Muhsin-e-Islam* (محسن اسلام) (Benefactor of Islam). There can be no greater truth than this.

##### From Abd al-Muttalib to the Prophet and Imam Ali

Brother, go even further up from this, Janab Abd al-Muttalib. Janab Abd al-Muttalib, who is Abd al-Muttalib? Abd al-Muttalib has two sons. Actually, he had more sons, but we'll mention two right now. One is Janab Abdullah, the father of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family). And the second is Janab Abu Talib, the father of Commander of the Faithful. Oh brother, you cannot find better sons than these in the world, can you? Can they be found? Such sons cannot be found in this world. Two sons, one who is the *Khatam-un-Nabiyyin* (خاتم النبیین) (Seal of the Prophets). And the other who is the *Sayyid al-Awsiya* (سید الاوصیاء) (Master of the Successors). Nothing greater than this can be found. Is it clear for you or not?

##### Quranic Designation: Shajara Tayyibah and Verse of Purity

Now you have seen this *shajara* (شجرہ) (lineage) on this side, right? This *shajara* (شجرہ), *shajara* (شجرہ) is what we call lineage. Right? *Shajara* (شجرہ) means tree. So lineage is called *shajara* (شجرہ) in Arabic. That's why they say, "Look at your *shajara* (شجرہ)." So *shajara* (شجرہ) is still in UP. The actual Sayyids have it. Right, for those who became Sayyids later, we don't know, we don't have it. It's clear, right? So *shajara* (شجرہ) is very important. The Quran has called this – these are not our words; if they were our words, you could stop us. The Quran has called these lineages *Shajara Tayyibah* (شجرة طيبة) (Good Tree). *Tayyibah* (طيبة) means pure. This was a pure tree, a pure lineage. From which these people emerged, so on one side, complete purity, full purity. And that purity which the Quran called *Shajara Tayyibah* (شجرة طيبة) (Good Tree), and after that, if anyone had any doubt, it was further validated through the Verse of Purity. Allah declared:

إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمُ الرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيرًا
Indeed, Allah desires to remove all impurity from you, O People of the Household, and to purify you with a thorough purification.

#### The Impure Lineage of Yazid

This is one side. Now look at the introduction of the other side; you have heard one side. There isn't much time, don't worry at all, okay?

##### Yazid's Character and Blasphemous Views

Who is on the other side? Yazid the accursed. Now what should we say about him? I mean, he himself was a wine-drinker. He gambled, played with monkeys, played with dogs, he had no belief, no religion. There is a very famous couplet about him because poets were common in Arabia during that era. Just like nowadays in UP, you see, whoever you look at is a poet. Meaning, anyone you see today. Every person is a poet. It doesn't matter if they have any qualification or not. But he is a poet. Similarly, among Arabs at that time, poetry was very prevalent. It was very common; everyone was a poet. So Yazid was also a poet. And nowadays, we have heard our own members mention his virtues, saying that Yazid was a poet. This is no virtue. In Arabia, every child used to be a poet. Every child was a poet, meaning, even when the *Aal-e-Muhammad* (آلِ محمد) (family of Muhammad, peace be upon them) went to fight in the battlefield, they would go reciting *rajaz* (رجز) (war poetry). Small children, nine or ten years old, they would go reciting *rajaz* (رجز), reciting full poems. "If you don't recognize me, then know who we are. We are the grandsons of Commander of the Faithful and the grandsons of Ja'far al-Tayyar, recognize us!" They would go reciting *rajaz* (رجز) like this. So Yazid was a poet. So what was one of Yazid's couplets? He says:

لعب الهاشم بالملك فلا خبر جاء ولا وحي نزل.
Bani Hashim played for kingship, no news came, nor any revelation descended.
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, Bani Hashim—Bani Hashim means the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family). Bani Hashim staged this pretense of Islam merely to gain power. Otherwise, no angel came with revelation. *Falah khabar jaa wa la wahyun nazal* (فلا خبر جاء ولا وحي نزل.) (No news came, nor any revelation descended.) No verse of the Quran was revealed. This was all a pretense; Islam was a pretense. What did the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) want to do with this? He wanted to gain power; the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) was doing all this to gain power. According to whom? According to Yazid. Now, there's no need to say much more about this; it's not even necessary to speak. People even justify him. Look, you don't know, do you? It's known by actions. For example, we see Sunnis celebrating on Ashura. They fast, they go to fairs, they wear new clothes. They do all these things on the day of Ashura. Now, from this, it becomes clear to them, their actions are understood. What are these people like. Right? By this, meaning, following Yazid. So you will know from Yazid's actions. Now, let's move forward.

##### Muawiya's Questionable Parentage (Hind)

His father, Muawiya. Muawiya is called Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan. They say, you must have heard the name, son of Abu Sufyan. Actually, he was not the son of Abu Sufyan at all. This is a historical fact. He was not the son of Abu Sufyan at all. Muawiya was the son of Umar, because Muawiya's mother, among Arabs, she was called *Sahibat al-Rayah* (صاحب الرایه) (the flag-bearer), explain this to the children. Meaning, she used to put up a flag. She was a loose character woman. His mother was a loose character. So anyway, now, whose child is it? Whose child is this? So then, she said that at that time, two men used to come frequently. One was Abu Sufyan and the other was Umar. So she said, "Okay, then who should be selected?" So she said, "Abu Sufyan." "Why select Abu Sufyan?" "Because Abu Sufyan is a very useless person," she said. Who said? Muawiya's mother. And who else is she, you also know who she is, don't you? Hind. Hind, his mother. Introduction, is an introduction needed? She ate the liver of Janab Hamza. She ate the liver of Janab Hamza in the Battle of Uhud. After cutting out the liver, does she seem like a normal woman to you? Nowadays, many things become common because women take that *nikah* (marriage contract) with them. That's a different thing. So look, in olden times, such a thing was not expected from respectable women. But she officially went to the battlefield. And she cut out Janab Hamza's liver, took it out, and chewed it. Just imagine what kind of woman she must have been. So people, she selected whom? She said, "Abu Sufyan." Later, people asked, "Why did you implicate Abu Sufyan?" She said, "Because he was wealthy. Umar was a miser; if he took money, he wouldn't even give a tip." That is, she said, these are her words. We are teaching you history so that you know who is in front of you. So she selected Abu Sufyan, that's why, actually, and this was the reason. This was the reason that as soon as Umar became caliph, he immediately appointed Muawiya—rather, Muawiya's elder brother, Yazid, his elder brother, Yazid, who died, he died quickly. So first, he made Yazid, meaning Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, the governor of Syria. As soon as he became caliph. But that Yazid died; he couldn't rule for long. So he immediately appointed his brother. Look, read history; it's very, very important to read history. He appointed him immediately. And what Muawiya did afterwards is clear to everyone.

##### Abu Sufyan and Umm Jamil (Abu Lahab's Wife)

His father, Abu Sufyan, was also like that. Abu Sufyan, how was Abu Sufyan born? His mother was also like that. Abu Sufyan's father's name, what was Abu Sufyan's own name? It was Sakhr. Actually, what they call him, Abu Sufyan, is a *kunyah* (کنیت) (agnomen). Among Arabs, when they address someone as *Abu* (ابو) or *Umm* (ام), it's called a *kunyah* (کنیت). Meaning, it's not the actual name, like Abu Talib; Janab Abu Talib's name wasn't Abu Talib. They called him Abu Talib out of respect. So what was the actual name? Imran. His name was Imran. Similarly, what was Abu Sufyan's title? Sakhr. Who was Sakhr's father? Harb. This Harb, this Harb who was the father of Abu Sufyan. He had simply kept a loose-character woman like that. And from her, he had these two children. Look, let's just finish this point, understand it. So that you know who the battle of Karbala was actually against. So he had two children. One child was this Abu Sufyan, whose name was Sakhr, Harb's son Sakhr. And his sister, her title was *Umm Jamil* (ام جمیل).

Who was this *Umm Jamil* (ام جمیل)? She is also mentioned in the Quran. Who is this *Umm Jamil* (ام جمیل)? She was Abu Lahab's wife. Abu Lahab (ابو لہب) was the paternal uncle of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family). The brother of Abu Talib (ابو طالب). But why did he turn against the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family)? He turned against him because he married her. So when she came, she came with the whole baggage. *Umm Jamil* (ام جمیل). So both brothers lived next to each other, right? There was a wall in between. So what would she do when the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) announced his prophethood, announced that he was a Prophet? She used to throw trash at the Holy Prophet's (peace be upon him and his holy family) house. And they were very wealthy, these people were very wealthy. Meaning, he was also very wealthy, Abu Sufyan (ابو سفیان) was also very wealthy, *Umm Jamil* (ام جمیل), Abu Lahab (ابو لہب), Abu Lahab (ابو لہب) was also very wealthy, they were very wealthy. And they would always boast about their wealth. They would keep saying in front of everyone, "We did this, we did that."

##### Quranic Denunciation: Surah Lahab and Shajara Khabeesah

The Quran (قرآن) in one verse, rather not one but two or three verses, completely removed all their arrogance. The Quran (قرآن) said. Meaning, it was Abu Lahab's (ابو لہب) habit to abuse everyone. And in Arabic (عربی), how would the abuse be? Like *Tabbat yada* (تَبَّتْ يَدَا) (May your hands be ruined). They used to say "May your hands be ruined" like that. So he was wealthy, and what do they say, he had power, a big family. People were afraid, people were scared. But when he showed enmity towards the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family), the Quran (قرآن) in one small Surah, which is called Surah Lahab (سورہ لہب), didn't it? So Surah Lahab (سورہ لہب) is a small Surah. In it, the Quran (قرآن) completely disgraced both husband and wife. The Quran (قرآن) said:

تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ.
May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he.
- [Reference needed]

The Quran (قرآن) returned his words to him in the same manner he spoke to others.

تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ. مَا أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُ مَالُهُ وَمَا كَسَبَ. سَيَصْلَىٰ نَارًا ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ.
May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he. His wealth and what he earned will not benefit him. He will [soon] enter a Fire of flaming blaze.
- [Reference needed]

There is a lot of exegesis for this; we are not going into detail, it will take a lot of time. Every single word has exegesis here.

سَيَصْلَىٰ نَارًا ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ. وَامْرَأَتُهُ حَمَّالَةَ الْحَطَبِ. فِي جِيدِهَا حَبْلٌ مِّن مَّسَدٍ.
He will [soon] enter a Fire of flaming blaze. And his wife [as well] – the carrier of firewood. Around her neck will be a rope of palm fiber.
- [Reference needed]

It is a verse of the Quran (قرآن). The Quran (قرآن) in one Surah badly disgraced both husband and wife. This was the character of both of them. You have now seen this entire family. So on one side is this family which the Quran (قرآن) called *Shajara Tayyibah* (شجرة طيبة) (Good Tree). Pure. And on the other side, this family which has been given the title *Shajara Khabeesah* (شجرة خبيثة) (Evil Tree). *Khabeesah* (خبيثة) means wretched, meaning *Jahannami* (جهنمی) (of Hell). Meaning, whose end is in fire. That is who this is. Now, the battle that took place in Karbala (کربلا) was a battle between these two lineages. It was a battle between truth (*haq* – حق) and falsehood (*batil* – باطل).

### The Profound Importance of Azadari (Mourning)

And that is why this *Azadari* (عزاداری) (mourning) has great importance. It has great value and significance. Do not take it lightly at all. Never think that "oh, this is just..." And it has no connection with crowds, it has no connection with spending money. No, if, for example, there is no one, just two people, and the one distributing has nothing but is just distributing water. Just water. As *tabarruk* (تبرك) (blessing). But with *khulus-e-niyyat* (خلوص نیت) (sincere intention). Then it has great importance.

#### Remembrance of Ahl al-Bayt as a Cure

That is why, look, a small hadith, Hujjatullah said: The Imam (امام) states that *Dhikruna Ahl al-Bayt* (ذکرنا اہل بیت) (our remembrance of the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them), *Dhikruna Ahl al-Bayt* (ذکرنا اہل بیت) is *shifa'un minal ilal wal asqaam* (شفاء من العلل والاسقام) (a cure from ailments and diseases). The remembrance of the Ahl al-Bayt (اہل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them) is a cure (*shifa* – شفا) from every kind of illness. Whatever the disease, the remembrance of the Ahl al-Bayt (اہل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them) is its cure (*shifa* – شفا). Of course, the first example in this refers to spiritual diseases. For spiritual diseases, the best thing is the remembrance of the Ahl al-Bayt (اہل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them). Meaning, if someone keeps remembering the Ahl al-Bayt (اہل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them), keeps reciting the remembrance of the Ahl al-Bayt (اہل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them), then all his spiritual illnesses will be removed. Provided that he is busy in the *dhikr Ahl al-Bayt* (ذکر اہل بیت) (remembrance of Ahl al-Bayt).

#### Protection from Satanic Whisperings

And what is the second thing? *Wa waswas-e-ghair* (ووسواس غير) (and other whisperings). Its second benefit. We are telling you the benefit of these gatherings. We are telling you the benefit of these gatherings. What is its first benefit? That it is a cure (*shifa* – شفا) for illness, spiritual diseases, spiritual ailments. Secondly, a person remains protected from the whisperings (*waswaso* – وسوسوں) of Satan (*Shaytan* – شیطان). From the whisperings (*waswaso* – وسوسوں) of Satan (*Shaytan* – شیطان). Look, of course, this does not mean that someone will become infallible (*ma'sum* – معصوم). There is no infallible (*ma'sum* – معصوم) person in the world. Every person makes mistakes; every person sins.

And the same thing happened during the time of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family). It's not that during the time of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family)... There was a companion of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) who came and said, "O Holy Prophet (*Ya Rasulullah* – یا رسول اللہ), when I sit with you, it feels like this world is worthless, I just want to keep sitting with you, it's very good, very great, it's very enjoyable." It feels like just recite Quran (قرآن), offer prayers, everything. It feels like performing the Greater Hajj (*Hajj Akbar* – حج اکبر) when I sit. "But as soon as I get up from you, when I meet my wife and children, and other friends, then I become like them. Then I start doing all those same actions again." So what did the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) reply? If it were someone like us, they would emphasize a bit of sanctity. "You are doing this very wrong." But the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) is the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family). The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) knew. The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) said, "What you do is natural." He said, "This is natural. When you are busy in the world, occupied, there will be some influence from worldly people." "If this were not the case, listen to this sentence of the Prophet (*Payghambar* – پیغمبر). If it were not so, then angels would shake hands with you, and you would walk on water. Meaning, you would become a Prophet (*Nabi* – نبی). You would become infallible (*ma'sum* – معصوم). No one is infallible (*ma'sum* – معصوم)."

Then after that, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) says a sentence. "If you did not sin, then Allah (اللہ) would create a nation that sins so that Allah (اللہ) may express His forgiveness (*maghfirat* – مغفرت). To express His forgiveness, to show how He forgives people." And in the Quran (قرآن), Allah (اللہ) has expressed this many times:

إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ
Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
- [Reference needed]

He is the Great Forgiver. That's why Allah (اللہ), meaning, one should never despair of Allah's (اللہ) mercy (*rahmat* – رحمت). Remember, after polytheism (*shirk* – شرک), after polytheism (*shirk* – شرک), the greatest sin is despairing of Allah's (اللہ) mercy (*rahmat* – رحمت). Allah (اللہ) forgives anyone. It is just that the belief (*aqeedah* – عقیدہ) must be correct.

#### Maintaining Connection with the Imam

That's why this *Azadari* (عزاداری) (mourning) has a very big role. The belief (*aqeedah* – عقیدہ) must be correct. If the belief (*aqeedah* – عقیدہ) is correct – belief (*aqeedah* – عقیدہ) in Allah (اللہ), belief (*aqeedah* – عقیدہ) in His Messenger (peace be upon him and his holy family), and if there is belief (*aqeedah* – عقیدہ) in the Ahl al-Bayt (اهل بیت) (the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them) – then no matter what a person's past was like, "when one wakes up, it's morning." And many times, it also happens that very religious people also slip. They go astray.

### The Peril of Deviation: The Case of Ibn Muljam

The people who were with the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) in the Battle of Siffin (*Jang Siffin* – جنگ صفین), right? Excellent. Master, you must have heard the name of *Ibn Muljam* (ابن ملجم), haven't you? We will finish this in 5 minutes, *Insha'Allah* (انشاء اللہ) (if Allah wills). You all look very tired.

You have heard the name of *Ibn Muljam* (ابن ملجم), haven't you? All of you have heard, is there anyone who hasn't heard? We don't take his first name, *Abd-us-Shaytan* (عبد الشیطان) (servant of Satan). Is it clear? His actual name was *Abd al-Rahman* (عبد الرحمن), but we call him *Abd-us-Shaytan* (عبد الشیطان) because he was a servant of Satan (*Shaytan* – شیطان). *Ibn Muljam* (ابن ملجم), *La'natullah alayh* (لعنۃ اللہ علیہ) (may the curse of Allah be upon him). May the curse (*la'nat* – لعنت) of Allah (اللہ) be upon him. Do you know what he did? He martyred Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon him). Do you know that he was a special companion of the Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon him) in Kufa (کوفہ)? And one day he came and said, "O Ali (*Ya Ali* – یا علی), I love you very much." "I love you very much." The Master (*Maula* – مولا) said, "You are lying." "You are lying." Because the Master (*Maula* – مولا) knew what was happening, didn't he? He said, "I insist, I insist that I love you." The Master (*Maula* – مولا) said, "You are lying." "Now, take this sword of mine and cut off my head." The Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) said, "This sword of yours will be for this purpose: with it, my beard will be dyed with blood." He said, "If that's the case, then kill me right now. Kill me now." The Master (*Maula* – مولا) said, "Not now. The punishment will be after the crime." The punishment will be after the crime.

And what happened? In the Battle of Siffin (*Jang Siffin* – جنگ صفین), when those people raised the Quranic (*Qurani* – قرآنی) banner, the Quran (قرآن), one of them was this one, they surrounded Commander of the Faithful. They said, "Stop the war now, otherwise we will kill you now. Stop the war, Ali (علی), right now, this very moment! Otherwise, we will kill you right now." So the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) had to call Malik Ashtar (مالک اشتر) back. He had to end the war at that very moment. Otherwise, Malik Ashtar (مالک اشتر) had reached Muawiya's (معاویہ) tent. And Malik Ashtar (مالک اشتر) also said for 5 minutes. When the men came with the message, Malik Ashtar (مالک اشتر) said, "Just give me a few moments. Just a few moments, Master (*Maula* – مولا), please give. Then Muawiya's (معاویہ) caravan would be finished." But the Master (*Maula* – مولا) – those people said the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) said that if you want to see Ali (علی) alive, then come back. So Malik Ashtar (مالک اشتر) immediately put his sword back in its scabbard and returned. So this happens, that many people who try to become very pious, who always show that everyone else is a sinner and only they are pious. And believe me, if anyone is born in 400 years, it's us. It's clear, right? Look, *hidayat* (ہدایت) (guidance) and *gumrahi* (گمراہی) (deviation), guidance and deviation, this is in Allah's (اللہ) hands. What should a person simply be? He should remain connected to his Imam (امام). He should remain connected to the Imam (امام). That connection should not be broken. If he breaks that connection, then it's very difficult. Just keep remembering the Imam (امام). Like the short supplication (*dua* – دعا) you recite, *Allahumma kun liwaliyyik* (اللهم کن لولیک) (O Allah, be a guardian for your representative). This much is enough. Enough means not really enough. But at least it's not enough. At least that much should be there. That *Allahumma kun liwaliyyik* (اللهم کن لولیک) should be recited daily. So this connection is very important. This connection is very important. So now here the Imam (امام) states, "from the whisperings (*waswaso* – وسوسو) of Satan (*Shaytan* – شیطان)." And then after that he says, "Whoever turns towards us (*mutawajjih* – متوجہ), whoever is attentive towards us, Allah (اللہ) will be pleased (*raazi* – راضی) with him." Here, they are explaining the importance of *Azadari* (عزاداری) (mourning). They are explaining the importance of this *majlis* (مجلس) (gathering) in which we are sitting. Allah (اللہ) will be pleased (*raazi* – راضی) with him.

And after that, he states the last sentence. He states that *Al-akhidhu bi amrina* (الْآخِذُ بِأَمْرِنَا) (the one who adheres to our command). Whoever accepts our command (*amr* – امر), meaning Shi'ism (*Shia'ism* – شیعہ ازم). Whoever accepts our command (*amr* – امر) will be with us in Paradise (*Jannat* – جنت) tomorrow. He will be with us in Paradise (*Jannat* – جنت) at our station (*muqam* – مقام). One who is a Shia (*Shia* – شیعہ). His connection with his Imam (امام) will remain. Who will be happy (*khush* – خوش) in our happiness (*khushi* – خوشی), and grieved (*ghamzada* – غمزدہ) in our sorrow (*gham* – غم). This is the basic condition. And that is why we establish this mourning gathering (*majlis-e-aza* – مجلس عزا). And that is why the Imam (امام) said, that for us, even a particle of grief in a human being is *tasbih* (تسبیح) (glorification).

### The Ultimate Sacrifice: The Martyrdom of Ali Asghar (AS)

This gathering, what is this a sign (*alamat* – علامت) of? What is this a sign (*alamat* – علامت) of? This is what you find in pilgrimages (*ziyarato* – زیارتوں), isn't it? You recite the pilgrimage (*ziyarat* – زیارت) of Imam Hussain (peace be upon him). So this is what you find.

#### Imam Hussain's Final Plea on Ashura

That the call Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) made on the day of Ashura (عاشور), this is your saying *Labbaik* (لبیک) (Here I am) to that call today. What Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) said on Ashura (عاشور):

هَلْ مِنْ نَاصِرٍ يَنْصُرُنَا
Is there any helper who will help us?
- [Reference needed]

Is there anyone who will help me?

هَلْ مِنْ مُغِيثٍ يُغِيثُنَا
Is there any helper who will aid us?
- [Reference needed]

Is there anyone to give us shelter?

هَلْ مِنْ ذَابٍ يَذُبُّ عَنْ حَرَمِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ
Is there any defender who will defend the sanctity of the Holy Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family)?
- [Reference needed]

Is there anyone who will defend the sanctity (*haram* – حرم) of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family), the honor (*namus* – ناموس) of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family), and his women? Is there anyone to defend them? No one answered. Because everyone had been martyred (*shaheed* – شہید).

#### The Call Answered by Ali Asghar

But suddenly, commotion (*kuhram* – کہرام) broke out in the tents (*khaimo* – خیموں). Cries and screams came from the tents (*khaimo* – خیموں). The Master of Martyrs (peace be upon him) came inside the tent (*khaima* – خیمہ). "Sister Janab Zainab (peace be upon them), what is this commotion (*kuhram* – کہرام)?" She said, "Brother, you raised the call for help (*awaz-e-istighatha* – آواز استغاثہ) and Asghar (peace be upon him) threw himself from the cradle." Asghar (peace be upon him) threw himself from the cradle. He said, "Sister, bring Asghar (peace be upon him) and hand him over to me." She said, "Brother, Asghar (peace be upon him) is not going to anyone. You come and see for yourself."

Now it is written in the account of martyrdom (*maqtal* – مقتل) that Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) came near the cradle (*gahwara* – گہوارے), near the swing, and who knows what the father said to the son, but 6-month-old Asghar (peace be upon him) came directly into his father's lap (*god* – گود). Asghar (peace be upon him) came into his father's lap (*god* – گود), Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) took Asghar (peace be upon him) and left, and as he left, the mother stood at the tent's entrance (*dar-e-khaima* – در خیمہ). Rabab was standing. Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) said, "Rabab, why are you standing here?" She said, "I am seeing that whoever went to the battlefield (*maqtal* – مقتل) since morning has not returned alive (*zinda* – زندہ). So I wanted to see my darling one more time. Let me see my son one more time." Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) consoled (*tasalli* – تسلی) Rabab, "Until now, those who went to the battlefield (*maidan* – میدان) went to fight. Do 6-month-old babies fight wars?" Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) consoled (*tasalli* – تسلی) her, and the mother's heart was settled.

Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) went, stood on a height, and taking Ali Asghar (peace be upon him) in his lap (*god* – گود), said,

أَبَا فِيكُمْ مُسْلِمٌ
Is there any Muslim among you?
- [Reference needed]

"Is there any Muslim (*Muslim* – مسلمان) among you? My child has been thirsty for three days." No one answered. Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) asked a second question, and that question was, "Even if you are not Muslim (*Muslim* – مسلمان), is there no one among you who is a parent (*sahib-e-awlad* – صاحب اولاد)?" "Oh, look at my child, he has been thirsty for three days." But still, no one answered. Now, the third sentence Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) said, and this was the third question: "Are you not seeing how he is *talazzi* (تَلَذُّق)?" *Talazzi* (تَلَذُّق) means that when a child, when a fish is taken out of water, and its breath becomes very low, its life force diminishes, and it takes its last breath, it sometimes opens its mouth and sometimes closes it. This is how a fish's last breath is. Ali Asghar (peace be upon him) would open and close his mouth like this on Ashura (عاشور). This state (*kaifiyat* – کیفیت) is called *talazzi* (تَلَذُّق). Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) used this word: "How my child is opening his mouth, how he is closing his mouth. His life is breaking."

#### The Brutal Act of Hurmala

Now, when Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) used these words, the wretched ones (*ashqiya* – اشقیاء) started turning their faces away and weeping. It was imminent (*anqareeb* – انقریب) that the effects of a revolution (*inqilab* – انقلاب) would appear (*ru nama* – رو نما), when Bisr ibn Sa'd called out, "O Hurmala (اے حرملہ)!" "Where is Hurmala (حرملہ)?" Hurmala (حرملہ) the accursed (*mal'un* – ملعون) came forward. Bisr ibn Sa'd said,

اِقْطَعْ كَلَامَ الْحُسَيْنِ
Cut off Hussain's speech.
- [Reference needed]

"Stop Imam Hussain's (peace be upon him) speech." Hurmala (حرملہ) took an arrow with a wide arrowhead (*teer bharka* – تیر بھارکا) and shot it at the sign. An arrow with a wide arrowhead (*teer bharka* – تیر بھارکا) was used among Arabs (*Arabon* – عربوں) at that time when hunting a large animal (*janwar* – جانور). Now here, for a 6-month-old baby, he shot an arrow with a wide arrowhead (*teer bharka* – تیر بھارکا). And this arrow struck the child in the throat (*galay* – گلے). The child turned over (*munqalib* – منقلب) in the father's lap (*god* – گود). Now when Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) saw, the child was smiling (*muskura* – مسکرا). "Father, don't worry."

#### Imam Hussain's Heart-Wrenching Return

Now what would Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) do? Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) wanted to take him towards the tents (*khaime* – خیمے). Now, after walking a short distance,

إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ
Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Him we shall return.
- [Reference needed]

We know the miracles (*karamat* – کرامت) of Ashura's (عاشور) deeds (*a'mal* – اعمال), don't we? We give our lives (*jaan* – جان) for this deed (*amal* – عمل), don't we? This became Imam Hussain's (peace be upon him) on the day of Ashura (عاشور): Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) was carrying Asghar's (peace be upon him) body (*lash* – لاش) towards the tents (*khaime* – خیمے).

إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ
Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Him we shall return.
- [Reference needed]

Then he came back, thinking, "How will I show this to the mother? How will the mother be able to see it?" Then he came back,

إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ
Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Him we shall return.
- [Reference needed]

Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) performed this action (*fa'l* – فعل) 7 times. Finally, he thought that the child had now departed from this world. "Why keep the mother deprived (*mahroom* – محروم) of the last glimpse (*deedar* – دیدار)?" He covered Asghar (peace be upon him) with the skirt of his cloak (*aba* – ابا).

#### Rabab and Sakina's Devastation

He came to the tent's entrance (*dar-e-khaima* – در خیمہ) and called out, "Rabab." Now listen to the last sentences of the martyrdom account (*maqtal* – مقتل). It is written in the *maqtal* (مقتل) that as soon as Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) called out "Rabab," Rabab came from one side, and Sakina (peace be upon them) came from the other. The little girl reached first. "Father, did my brother drink water (*pani* – پانی)? Father, now my brother is not thirsty, is he?" Sakina (peace be upon them) was still asking. After that, Rabab arrived. As soon as the mother arrived, Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) lifted the skirt of his cloak (*aba* – ابا). The mother saw a sight (*manzar* – منظر) that Allah (اللہ) should not show to any mother. A 6-month-old beloved child, an arrow with a wide arrowhead (*teer bharka* – تیر بھارکا) embedded (*paiwast* – پیوسط). The mother recited a lament (*marsiya* – مرثیہ), "O my son (*Ya Bunayya* – يا بني),

أَبِنْ شَقَّ أَيُّ النَّحْرِ
How can a neck like yours be cut?
- [Reference needed]

"Are children like you also sacrificed (*zabh* – ذبح)?" Rabab composed her heart. Rabab composed her heart. Then she moved forward. Then on 11th Muharram (محرم), the wretched ones (*ashqiya* – اشقیاء) separated the heads from each body (*jism* – جسم) and raised them on spears. Finally, when there were 71 heads (*sar* – سر), one head (*sar* – سر) was missing. So someone told everyone, "This one head (*sar* – سر) that is left is the head (*sar* – سر) of that child whom Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) had brought." Rabab was also asking. These wretched ones (*ashqiya* – اشقیاء) started striking their swords (*talwaro* – تلواروں) behind Imam Hussain's (peace be upon him) tents (*khaime* – خیمے) with their swords (*talwaro* – تلواروں). Until one wretched one (*shaqi* – شقی) struck such a blow to a chest (*seena* – سینہ) that a head (*sar* – سر) emerged from it. And that head (*sar* – سر) was raised. And that head (*sar* – سر) was raised in such a way, illuminating (*tanwar* – تنور) it, Allahu Akbar (اللہ اکبر) (Allah is the greatest).

O Lord, hasten the advent (*zuhur* – ظہور) of Imam al-Zaman (peace be upon him). Count us among his helpers (*a'wan* – اعوان) and supporters (*ansar* – انصار). Remove the troubles of those who are in distress. Enable those who are in debt to repay their debts. Grant righteous and pious offspring to those who are childless. Grant complete (*shifa kamila* – شفاء کاملہ) and swift (*'ajila* – عاجلہ) recovery (*shifa* – شفاء) to those who are ill. Return those who are far from their homeland safe and sound (*sahih-o-salim* – صحیح و سالم). Protect the lives, wealth, honor, and dignity of the Shias of Haydar al-Karrar (Commander of the Faithful), wherever they are in the world. Protect the world's scholars (*ulama-e-alam* – علمائے عالم) and grand religious authorities (*maraji' azam* – مراجع عظام). Protect the holy shrines (*rawdat-e-muqaddasah* – روضات مقدسہ). And protect those who are protecting them. Especially protect the shrine of Janab Zainab (peace be upon them). And protect those who are protecting them. O Lord, honor (*musharraf* – مشرف) us in this world with the pilgrimage (*ziyarat* – زیارت) to Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy family) and the family of Muhammad (peace be upon them), and in the afterlife with the intercession (*shafa'at* – شفاعت) of Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy family) and the family of Muhammad (peace be upon them). Mourning for Hussain.
