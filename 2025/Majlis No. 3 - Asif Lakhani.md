> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Central Teaching**: The Quranic principles of forgiveness (Al-Afw), enjoining good (Al-Urf), and turning away from the ignorant (Al-Jahilin) form the foundation of divine conduct, which must be practically implemented as demonstrated by the Prophet (PBUH) and Ahlul Bayt (AS).

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Distinction**: True Imamate is divine guidance that transcends worldly power, with the Imams serving as administrators of Allah's servants through unseen knowledge, not mere political leadership.

> **For Daily Practice**: Adopt the three-fold approach - constantly forgive others, actively promote intellectual good (not just rituals), and avoid futile arguments even when you're right.

> [!WARNING]
> **Critical Balance**: Never subordinate the fundamental belief in Wilayah to ritualistic observances, though both are essential for spiritual development.

### 1. The Three Pillars of Divine Conduct

In this noble verse, Allah, the Exalted, states: "O Prophet, make forgiveness, that is, pardoning, your way of life; make it your motto; forgive people. Do not hold onto people's mistakes, and deal with people very gently, with great tenderness."

The verse presented to you before was **وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ** (and enjoin what is right), which means always enjoin goodness. Just enjoin goodness, keep doing good. **وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ.** (And enjoin what is right.) I had also explained that *‘urf* (عرف) means *ma’roof* (معروف – good). *Ma’roof* means goodness, and we repeat *ma’roof* repeatedly so that it becomes well-preserved in your noble minds. *Ma’roof* means that which the intellect deems correct. The intellect says it is correct, and the intellect finds pleasure in doing that act. That is why an example was presented to you; the Imam said: "Look, don't just focus on prayer and fasting. Don't just focus on Hajj. Look at all these things. When he speaks, does he speak the truth or not? And does he act with trustworthiness or not?" This itself is a very vast topic, which we don't need to go into details about right now.

And the third thing is **وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْجَاهِلِينَ.** (And turn away from the ignorant.) This means, turn away from the ignorant. That is, do not argue unnecessarily with the ignorant, do not talk to them, do not get entangled with them, because entangling with the ignorant will not bring any benefit. Even if you are right, even then. That is why in our narrations, one thing is strictly forbidden, which is called *Miraa* (مِراء) in narrations. *Miraa* means unnecessary argumentation. It is strictly forbidden. That is, morally, it is Haram (forbidden), morally. It is not Shari' (legally forbidden), but morally, meaning the intellect absolutely forbids it. If you have to state your point, state it. After that, do not continue the discussion. If someone understands, as there is a proverb in Arabic, they say: **إِنْ قُلْتَ فَأَقُولُ.** (If you say [this], then I will say [that].) If you say this, I will say this; if you say this, I will say this – this is called *Miraa*. Unnecessary argumentation, unnecessary entanglement. This is forbidden. What is the narration about this? What is the Hadith? That:

**أُتْرُكِ الْمِرَاءَ وَلَوْ كُنْتَ مُحِقَّا**
(Abandon argumentation, even if you are in the right.)
- [Reference needed]

Abandon *Miraa*. *Miraa* means do not argue unnecessarily. Even if you are on the side of truth. Even if you are right, a hundred percent right. Present your viewpoint. If the other person understands, that's fine; if not, no problem. I have stated my point. If you want to accept it, accept it; if not, don't. There is no benefit in arguing unnecessarily. So, that is why it is said **وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْجَاهِلِينَ.** (And turn away from the ignorant.)

And the verse from Surah Al-Furqan that was recited to you, that:

**عباد الرحمن الذین یمشون علی الارض هوناً.**
(The servants of the Most Gracious are those who walk upon the earth humbly.)
- [Reference needed]

That is, the servants of Allah are those who walk humbly on the earth, and when the ignorant address them, they say **السلام علیکم.** (Peace be upon you.) That is, they do not clash with the ignorant, they do not argue with the ignorant. They have no concern with the ignorant.

### 2. The Prophet's Practical Implementation of Divine Strategy

Now look, this strategy—actually, these are three words of the verse, aren't they? This is a strategy. If you ponder over it, this means that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief) is a mercy to all the worlds. He has to preach. See, by the will of Allah, we will present each point to you, and you will see how the Prophet dealt with things and how he practically acted upon this verse. Because the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, was not someone who merely spoke words. No, but practically, and anyway, in our Islam, this is also a rational point. And every person accepts it, whether they are Hindu, Muslim, or from any religion, any faith. You see, there's a proverb in English, isn't there? They say, "Practice what you preach." What you preach, you should act upon it.

And the Hadith of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) is even more powerful than that. Because what can be said about them? Now see, what is the sentence? They say:

**الدَاعِي بلا عمل كَالرَامِي بلا وتر.**
(The one who invites without عمل (action) is like an archer without a bowstring.)
- [Reference needed]

If someone throws an arrow like this, pulling it back and hitting it, will anything happen from it? Similarly, if someone is preaching without acting upon it themselves, it's like we don't understand bow and arrow these days, so let's say a gun, a pistol, its bullet. So instead of a gun, you throw the bullet by hand. The whole magazine of an AK-56, you just throw it forward. Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen. No matter how much you speak. That's why we tell you, you said, "Why do our words not have an effect?" This is the reason. Recite a Salawat.
**اللهم صل على محمد و آل محمد و عجل فرجهم.** (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief.)
It's clear, isn't it? The Prophet practically demonstrated every single thing, and by Allah's will, we will present that to you. So, what was this? This was a strategy that Allah revealed through a verse, through verse 199 of Surah Al-A'raf. Allah told the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, that "You must do these three things. And you must do them at every stage of life and interact with all people in this manner."

**خُذِ الْعَفْوَ** (Take to forgiveness). Keep forgiving. Look, this is how powerful it is. And generally speaking, putting aside this Quranic verse, try to adopt this in your life. Don't think too much. Whoever wronged you, whoever wronged you terribly, don't even mention them. Just look, we are talking about ourselves, that we should see how we can improve ourselves. That's it. What he did, what he is doing, what he is – it doesn't matter. In fact, we would go a step further and tell you that if someone is doing bad to you, then the more they work against you, the more you work hard to improve yourself, so that you work more on yourself than they work on you. So that in the end, they themselves admit defeat. They themselves give up. Therefore, constantly keep improving yourself.

### 3. The Significance of Ziyarat Jamia Kabira and the Infallibles' Status

What strategy did Allah give the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family? And look, that's why you must read Ziyarat Jamia Kabira. This is an emphasis from Imam Mahdi (Imam Mahdi, may Allah hasten his noble reappearance, (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief)). He emphasized this greatly. He said, **الجامعہ، الجامعہ، الجامعہ** (The Jami'a, the Jami'a, the Jami'a). Keep reading Ziyarat Jamia. He especially tells the youth: "Look, nowadays, thank God, you have all the facilities. These apps that come, what do they call it in English, that app? Divine Pearls, excellent! Those children, Zahid Bhai's sons, both of them, the Jani brothers, may Allah increase their divine success, Allah has blessed them with youth like this; they have done tremendous work. So, you see, Ziyarat Jamia is inside Divine Pearls. It's concise, not too long. Yes, it's a bit long, but if you can't read half of it at once, read it five or ten minutes at a time. You will see, gradually, you will gain full command over it, and definitely read its translation."

Now, let me present to you its opening words, and we will emphasize one word a bit more. The Ziyarat begins like this: "Okay, let me tell you one more thing. This Ziyarat was first narrated by Sheikh Sadooq in his book *Man La Yahdhuruhu al-Faqih*. Sheikh Sadooq narrated it in *Man La Yahdhuruhu al-Faqih*, and you know *Man La Yahdhuruhu al-Faqih* is one of our *Kutub al-Arba'a* (Four Books). It is one of our four books. The four books are: *Al-Kafi*, *Man La Yahdhuruhu al-Faqih*, *Al-Istibsar*, and *Tahdhib al-Ahkam*. These are four important books. *Man La Yahdhuruhu al-Faqih* is one of them. You know what Sheikh Sadooq writes at the beginning of this book? You should know this. Sheikh Sadooq writes that 'I make all the narrations in this book, whatever narrations I have cited, a *hujjah* (proof) between me and Allah.' Meaning, 'All the narrations I have cited are authentic.' This is my full guarantee. If there is anything doubtful in it, then on the Day of Judgment, one can grab my collar and question me." Sheikh Sadooq is giving a full guarantee; *hujjah* means exactly that. "It's my full guarantee, one hundred percent my guarantee."

Sheikh Sadooq is not a minor figure. Don't take Sheikh Sadooq lightly. Sheikh Sadooq's title is **R'as al-Muhadditheen** (Chief of Narrators). A very great personality, a very great personality. That is, if we were to talk about him now, it would be a separate topic, requiring a separate session, just to talk about Sheikh Sadooq. Anyway, he narrated this Ziyarat Jamia in *Man La Yahdhuruhu al-Faqih*. Its initial sentences, the beginning sentences, are as follows:

**اَلسَّلامُ عَلَیْکُمْ یَا اَهْلَ بَیْتِ النُّبُوَّةِ.**
(Peace be upon you, O Family of Prophethood.)
- [Reference needed]

**وَمَوْضِعَ الرِّسَالَةِ.**
(And the place of the Message.)
- [Reference needed]

It's strange, every single word is very strange. *Mawdhi'a Risala* (موضع رسالة) means that place where the message is found. *Mawdhi'* means place. That place where the message, meaning Allah's Messenger is there, Allah's message is found there.

**موضع الرسالہ**
(The place of the Message.)
- [Reference needed]

**وَمُخْتَلَفَ الْمَلَائِكَةِ**
(And the frequent resort of angels.)
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, angels come and go. Angels are servants of the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them. Someone asked Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), peace be upon him: "Are angels servants of the family of the Prophet?" The Imam said, "They are servants of our Shia." Recite blessings upon Muhammad and his family. (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief.) And do not consider this too extravagant; the position of the Shia is very high. They are the servants of the Shia. **الملائکہ خدام الشیعتنا.** (The angels are servants of our Shia.) You can demand service from the angels; it's just that a person must have the ability to command their servants. Recite blessings upon Muhammad and his family. (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief.)

"We are that household, **مہبط الوحی.** (the descent place of revelation.) The descent of revelation. And **و معدن الرحمۃ.** (the mine of Mercy.) We are the treasure of Allah's mercy. The mine of Allah's mercy; the family of the Prophet is the mine of mercy. If you want Allah's mercy, come to the door of the Holy Prophet's family.

The address begins in this manner. After that, a sentence comes:

**و ساست العباد.**
(And the administrators of the servants.)
- [Reference needed]

This is a topic of ours that is ongoing. What is the Holy Prophet's family? **ساست العباد.** (The administrators of the servants.) *Saasah* (سأسہ) in Arabic is the plural of *Sa'is* (سائس), administrator. You use this word very much in Urdu, *sa'isah* (سائسہ), from *siyasah* (سیاسة). When they say *siyasah* in Arabic, it does not mean politics. In Arabic, *siyasah* means organizing all the affairs of the servants. "We organize all the affairs of the servants." The Holy Prophet's family organizes Allah's servants; notice the sentence, notice the words. The Holy Prophet's family, because of their knowledge, there is a narration from Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief). The Imam says: "By Allah, if our obedience was not obligatory upon you, you would not even be worthy of us allowing you to stand at our door." The Imam swears by Allah and says this. "If our obedience was not obligatory." And then the Imam's statement, listen to what the Imam's words are. The Imam says, "We do not speak any word from our own opinion."

**لا نقُولُ بِرَأْيِنَا.**
(We do not speak according to our own opinion.)
- [Reference needed]

We do not say anything from our heart, meaning from desire. Rather, we only say what has been given to us by Allah's knowledge. Besides that, we say nothing. Meaning, this implies that:

**وَمَا يَنطِقُ عَنِ الْهَوَى إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا وَحْيٌ يُوحَى.**
(Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination. It is not but a revelation revealed.)
- [Reference needed]

That the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, does not speak on his own; he only says what is revealed to him. This is not only for the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, but for the entire Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them, whose discourse is only from the unseen knowledge, and the words of others are from their own thoughts, their own conjectures. And that is why there is a difference: the knowledge of the unseen is light, and the words of others are darkness. This is the difference between light and darkness. This is a very important thing.

The Imam says, "We only speak that." So, the Imam organizes all things, in every way: **ساست العباد.** (The administrators of the servants.) And this is only based on the unseen knowledge. So, the Imam says that we, the people... what is the Imam's responsibility? To guide the people. Remember, the Imams, peace be upon them, guide the people in every situation, whether they have apparent government or not. It makes no difference. See, this is a very important sentence we are presenting to you.

### 4. The True Meaning of Imamate Versus Worldly Power

What happened after the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family? After the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, some people sat in the place of Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), peace be upon him. They thought that they had gained power, so now they are in power, everything is theirs. Now, here we present two verses from Safdar Ja'far. Safdar Ja'far says:

They seated others on your pulpit, O worthy of Mustafa, manifestation of the Almighty.
You remained Ali, the Wali, the Wasi (executor), what deficiency came to your status?
- [Reference needed]

Did Ali's status diminish in any way? What is this worldly government? What is its value in Ali's eyes? Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) himself states in many places, which, by Allah's will, is a separate topic.

Yes, so people understood that this government is everything. They sat there. Now after that, what did they do? After 100, 200 years passed, they even changed the definition of Imamate, which is the definition we have here, but we don't need to go into the definition of Imamate now. We are just hinting. They made a definition of Imamate on their own. And what was it? What is Imamate? Imamate is the name of government. *Ar-Riyasah* (الریاسہ), what is Imamate? It is leadership. *Khilafah an-Nabi fi Umur ad-Deen wa ad-Dunya* (Successorship of the Prophet in matters of religion and world). Worldly affairs. *Riyasah*, **إن الامامۃ ریاسۃ عامۃ فی امور الدین و الدنیا.** (Indeed, Imamate is a general leadership in matters of religion and world.) Imamate means government, that's it. They thought that with this definition, they became completely correct. And after that, they added a little more to it. Now, when they said that if an Imam became an Imam by power, now he cannot be removed, even if he is *fasiq* (impious) and *fajir* (immoral). Children will not understand *fasiq* and *fajir* because our children do not understand these things. So, we explain in a simpler language: meaning, even if he is a drunkard, it's fine; even if he is a kebab-eater, it's fine; even if he is a libertine, it's fine, but he is the Imam. This became their definition. Now they would say, "Brother, what is it? No, he just came to power, so **نَحْنُ مَعَ مَنْ غَلَبَ.** (We are with whoever dominates.)" This is just a brief summary I presented to you.

But the Holy Prophet's family is not like that. How are the Holy Prophet's family? What is their aim? What is their purpose? To guide the people. In every situation. In every situation, they guide them. Whether the Holy Prophet's family is in power or not. What is the only condition? This is important. What is the condition? The condition is that you go to the door of the Holy Prophet's family. You go to the door of the Holy Prophet's family. That is why the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, said:

**مَثَلُ الْإِمَامِ مَثَلُ الْكَعْبَةِ.**
(The example of the Imam is like the example of the Kaaba.)
- [Reference needed]

**تُوتَى وَلا تُؤْتَى.**
(It is visited, but it does not visit.)
- [Reference needed]

Do they come to your house so you can perform Hajj there? No, we have to go to the Kaaba. Similarly, we should go to the door of the Imam. When we go to the door of the Imam, we can benefit from the Imam. And understand what benefit means, because there are many people who narrate different things, and we will only present to you from Ahadith (narrations). Nothing other than Hadith. If you have anything other than that, then bring us the Hadith. See, we only talk about the Quran and Hadith, brother. "So-and-so is saying this, so-and-so is saying that." This is not a *hujjah* (proof) for us, brother. No matter how great someone is, no matter how great, they are not equal to the sandals of Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him. Recite blessings upon Muhammad and his family. (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief.)

That is why a man came to the Imam and said that he could not connect with him. Contact with you means connection. He could not meet you. And "we have needs. What should we do? How should we do it?" What did the Imam say? Look, we are telling all the children, remember this. Always stay connected to your Imam. Always stay connected to your Imam, never forget your Imam. In every situation, whatever your condition may be. What did he say? Listen to the sentence.

**حرك شفتيك**
(Move your lips)
- [Reference needed]

**فإن الجواب يأتي.**
(for the answer will come.)
- [Reference needed]

Now, here, "answer" does not mean someone will directly come and say, "This is the answer." No. Allah will create a means. Allah will create means, a way by which the message reaches you. So, yesterday we presented this to you.

### 5. Addressing Misconceptions: The Importance of Wilayah Over Superficial Piety

Now, let's move forward and mention another very important point. Look, sometimes some people among us have a very strong zeal for preaching, and that's good, they should. But sometimes, its direction changes a little. And the direction changes such that some people become so captivated by prayer and fasting, what do they call it, so much so that they become so attached to prayer that they are ready to sacrifice Wilayah (guardianship) for prayer. They are ready to sacrifice the love of the Holy Prophet's family.

Now we will tell you a small incident, and after that, we will also present its proof from Hadith. Look, sometimes among us there are some reciters, some people – not all – who say that "if you come to a Majlis (mourning gathering) and, for example, you don't even pray, then your coming to the Majlis is useless. There is no benefit in coming to the Majlis." And they address women: "If you come unveiled, then your coming to the Majlis is useless." You might have heard this. I don't know if you have heard it, but I have heard it a lot. Such talk. Let's move a little further, please, before the prayer.
(O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief.)

Allah, the Exalted, says in the Quran, it is a verse from Surah Al-Mujadila:

**یا ایها الذین آمنوا اذا قیل لكم تفسحوا فی المجالس فافسحوا یفسح الله لكم.**
(O you who have believed, when you are told, "Make space in the assemblies," make space; Allah will make space for you.)
- [Reference needed]

This is a Quranic verse from Surah Al-Mujadila. Recite another Salawat. (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief.) A companion came to Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him. The Imam's dining cloth was spread, and the Imam said, "Come, sit down." So, he sat down; there was no one else there except him. But someone was nudging him. So, he said, "O son of the Messenger of Allah, there is no one here, so who is nudging me?" The Imam said, "These are angels who jostle to sit at our dining cloth." Similarly, for the gathering of Lady Zahra, peace be upon her. (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief.)

So, let me tell you a recent incident. A very great Marja' (religious authority) passed away, Ayatollah Sayed al-Hakeem. He passed away a few years ago, not much time, perhaps two, three, or four years at most. His son, Riyadh al-Hakeem, is still in Qom and also lives in Najaf. You can even confirm this incident with him. And Riyadh al-Hakeem's son-in-law is Mahdi Modarresi, whom you probably know. I think he is his son-in-law, Mahdi Modarresi. Right? You are aware. So, Ayatollah Sayed al-Hakeem, as you know, Marja's hold special gatherings of mourning in their homes during the days of mourning. Regular gatherings are held in the house of Marja'iyyah, and they invite good reciters to recite. Ayatollah Hakeem also invited an excellent reciter named Dujaili, or rather, Sayed Dujaili, who is very famous in Iraq. Ask anyone about Sayed Dujaili. Sayed Dujaili is such that, when he recites the tragedies, there is a saying among Iraqis that even stones weep. So powerful.

Now, he was invited to the Marja'iyyah, meaning to the Marja's house, and asked to recite. As he was reciting, he got a bit carried away with the zeal of preaching and started saying, "If you come to this mourning gathering and don't reform yourselves, then your coming to this mourning gathering is useless. Crying for Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, is useless." As soon as he said that, Sayed Hakeem took off his turban, stood in front of him, and said, "Sayed, what nonsense are you talking about?" He rebuked him strongly. "What are you talking about? That if you don't reform yourselves, there's no benefit in coming? 'Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, went out for reform' – haven't you heard such things?" He said, "Coming to the gathering of Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, and weeping for him benefits everyone who weeps for him, even if they are not Muslim. Even if they are not Muslim." So, Sayed Dujaili said, "My Master, as far as it concerns Shias and believers, I understand, but you say even if they are not Muslim?" Right there in that gathering, in that Majlis. So, he said, "Yes, even if they are not Muslim." Now listen to Sayed Hakeem's statement: "If they are not Muslim, then Allah might increase their sustenance (1), Allah might increase their lifespan (2), in worldly terms, and (3) this weeping for the Master of Martyrs (Imam Hussain) might become a cause for their guidance."

When this incident was narrated, some people might say, "Oh, this is not a *hujjah* (proof) for us, it's not evidence, because he is not speaking from the Quran or Hadith, he is a Marja' at-Taqlid (source of emulation)." Yes, he said one more sentence. He said, "Sayed, where are you speaking from? Are you speaking from the Quran? From Hadith? Or giving a fatwa of some Marja'? Whose words are you speaking?" He had no answer. Then these things were said. But we present to you a proof from Hadith. Listen to the proof from Hadith. It is found in a narration, and this narration is cited by Allama Majlisi in *Bihar al-Anwar*, Volume Twelve, where the story of Prophet Musa, peace be upon him, and Qarun is. You know Qarun was Prophet Musa's cousin, upon whom Allah's punishment descended. When this punishment was descending upon Qarun – this is present in the narration in *Bihar al-Anwar* – Qarun received the news, probably it was a Barzakhi (inter-world) punishment, a punishment in Barzakh, that Prophet Musa, peace be upon him, had passed away, or Prophet Haroun, peace be upon him. We don't remember exactly, but one of the two brothers: either Prophet Musa or Prophet Haroun had passed away. So, Qarun said:

**وا اسفا علی آل عمرانا**
(Oh, what a sorrow for the family of Imran!)
- [Reference needed]

This **وا اسفا** is used in Arabic for mourning, for expressing regret. "Oh, sorrow, that a son of Imran – Imran was Prophet Musa's father's name – one son of Imran has passed away." Because Imran was Qarun's uncle, and Haroun was his cousin-brother. So, "Oh, he has passed away, oh, he has passed away!" – the regret he expressed. Allah liked this gesture of Qarun so much that Allah stopped Qarun's punishment for that long. So, the proof is: where is Qarun and Prophet Musa, peace be upon him, and where is Imam Hussain, peace be upon him? Can there be any comparison? There can be no comparison. Meaning, where is Prophet Musa, peace be upon him, and where is Imam Hussain, peace be upon him? And no matter how bad we are, we are not worse than Qarun. We are not worse than Qarun. So, if Allah can stop Qarun's punishment, then if someone weeps for Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, what is surprising if Allah forgives their sins?

So, do not say such things. Never, never mix beliefs, Wilayah, with any minor matters of religion. That is, beliefs, Usul ad-Din (principles of religion), and Wilayah have their own special place, and actions have their own separate place. This does not mean that one should not perform actions. Yes, actions should be performed; prayer should be performed, fasting should be observed, it is very important. And if someone intentionally does not pray, it is possible that their intentional abandonment of prayer, fasting, and obligatory duties might take them outside of Wilayah. This is also possible. It is also possible that they become distant from the Holy Prophet's family and might even become an enemy of the Holy Prophet's family. That is also possible. Therefore, all these acts of worship are very necessary, very essential, and that is why there is a very famous Hadith that the Imam says:

**مَنْ کَانَ لِلّٰہِ مُطِیْعًا فَھُوَ لَنَا وَلِیْ**
(Whoever is obedient to Allah, he is our friend),
- [Reference needed]

**وَمَنْ کَانَ لِلّٰہِ عَاصِیًا فَھُوَ لَنَا عَدُوٌّ**
(and whoever disobeys Allah, he is our enemy.)
- [Reference needed]

Therefore, never take prayer and fasting lightly.

But as I mentioned yesterday, what is *Ma’roof* (good)? *Ma’roof* is to put everything in its proper place. Yesterday, I explained the definition of *Adl* (justice): to put everything in its proper place. Yesterday, I presented an example to you that Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, said to someone, "That is my father's pulpit." It's clear, isn't it?

### 6. Historical Manifestations of Ahlul Bayt's Steadfastness and Justice

Now today, another example is from the narrations of the Holy Prophet's family. You see, recite a Salawat upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad. (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief.) You see what happened? After the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, the government came, but the rulers' government lasted for two years and three months. I told you in the first session what the reason for each one was in the first session: none of them died a natural death. Remember this history I am telling you. Okay, then the second ones came and they lasted for ten years. Only ten years. And he was also murdered. Okay? Who did it? Abu Lu'lu'. May Allah bless Abu Lu'lu'. Recite a Salawat upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad. (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief.) May Allah bless Abu Lu'lu'. Abu Lu'lu' committed the murder. After that, the whole plan of those people became fruitful. The government came into the hands of Bani Umayyah. Bani Umayyah. The war that started against Islam, look, we strongly emphasize to the children: definitely read history. When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, brought Islam, who was the first to oppose him? Bani Umayyah. Among Quraish, who was it? Bani Umayyah. In Mecca, who was it? Bani Umayyah. They opposed him. The Messenger of Allah's uncle, Abu Lahab, opposed him. But why did he do it? Because Abu Sufyan's sister was married to him. He was his brother-in-law, wasn't he? So, whatever his brother-in-law said, he had to listen. So, he completely turned towards him. Whatever he said, Abu Lahab completely started opposing the Messenger of Allah. The Messenger of Allah's real uncle, Abu Lahab. You can imagine that his wife had so much control that he completely opposed his nephew. The others who were there, other individuals from Bani Hashim, like Abu Talib, peace be upon him, supported him. And his other special individuals supported him. Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), peace be upon him, was already there. No one else was in support. Abu Lahab and his wife. A verse of the Quran, a Surah was revealed, you know, where it says:

**تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ**
(May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he.)
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, it was revealed in condemnation of him. There is a whole history to it, let's leave it. So, Bani Umayyah opposed him. Abu Sufyan fought wars against the Messenger of Allah. Battle of Badr, Abu Sufyan. Battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan. Until the Conquest of Mecca, in all the wars the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, fought, Abu Sufyan was directly or indirectly involved. If he couldn't be directly, he would indirectly say, "Brother, what support do you need? You need this, you need that, I am ready to support you. I cannot come directly." Where he could come directly, he came directly. But everyone has limitations, don't they? So, he formally confronted. Read history. Meaning, there were formal wars, frontiers were created. Now, see what happens after that.

Now, when the Conquest of Mecca happened, he had to accept Islam. Listen to this word very carefully, all of you. Those who embraced Islam after the Conquest of Mecca, the Muslims gave them a word: *Tulaqa'* (طُلقاء). *Tulaqa'*? What are *Tulaqa'*? Freed slaves. Because Muslims had two options: one, to execute Abu Sufyan and his son, end the whole matter. The second option? To leave them. Some people were shouting that day, **الْیَوْمُ یَوْمُ الْمَلْحَمَةُ** (Today is the day of massacre!) after the Conquest of Mecca. "Today is the day of fighting, the day of revenge." The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, said, "No, **الْیَوْمُ یَوْمُ الْمَرْحَمَةُ** (Today is the day of mercy)." You see, **خُذِ الْعَفْوَ** (Take to forgiveness) from the Quran. "Today is the day of mercy." The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, forgave them. But he put a label on them. He put a label on them, and what was that label? *Tulaqa'*. *Tulaqa'* is the plural of *Taliq* (طالق). *Taliq* means one who has been set free, one who has been abandoned. A freed slave who has been left. That is why when Yazid said to Lady Zainab, peace be upon her, "See how Allah has disgraced you," Lady Zainab reminded him of his place by saying:

**اُسْکُتْ یَابْنَ الطُّلَقَا.**
(Be silent, O son of the freed slaves!)
- [Reference needed]

Recite blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad. (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief.) The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, placed such a stamp that it will remain until the Day of Judgment.

But what happened? Now these people came to power. They came to power when? The third ruler. So now what happened? One day, I will read it directly from a book for you. Recite a Salawat upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad. (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and hasten their relief.) Abu Sufyan, meaning the sentence from the Hadith is:

**اَنَّ سُفْیَانَ اَخَذَ بِیَدِ الْحُسَیْنِ حِیْنَ بُوْیِعَ عُثْمَانُ**
(Indeed, Sufyan took the hand of Husayn when Uthman was pledged allegiance to.)
- [Reference needed]

This was an incident I mentioned yesterday; this is a second one. He took the hand of Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, **وَقَالَ یَابْنَ اَخِیْ** (And he said, "O son of my brother,"). See, he addressed Imam Hussain. "O my nephew, **اُخْرُجْ مَعِیْ اِلٰی بَقِیْعِ** (Come out with me to Baqi')." Go to Baqi'. Jannat al-Baqi', isn't it? "Go there." The old name of Baqi' was Baqi' al-Gharqad. They used to call it Baqi' al-Gharqad. "You come with me to Baqi'." Which we call Jannat al-Baqi'. "So, go to Baqi'." **فَخَرَجَ** (So he went out.) He took Imam Hussain's hand, so Imam Hussain went with him. **فَخَرَجَ حَتّٰى اِذَا تَوَسَّطَ الْقُبُوْرَ** (So he went out until, when they reached the middle of the graves,) **اِجْتَرَّہُ** (he pulled him.) He pulled Imam Hussain's hand. **فَصَاحَ بِاَعْلٰی صَوْتِہِ** (and he cried out with his loudest voice.) Who? Abu Sufyan. He cried out in a loud voice:

**یَا اَہْلَ الْقُبُوْرِ اَلَّذِیْ کُنْتُمْ تُقَاتِلُوْنَ عَلَیْہَا صَارَ بِاَیْدِیْنَا**
(O people of the graves, that for which you fought has come into our hands.)
- [Reference needed]

You were fighting us for power, weren't you? Now power has come into our hands. Abu Sufyan said. "Now that power is in our hands, **وَ اَنْتُمْ رَمِیْمٌ** (And you are decayed bones.)" You are dust, dirt, you have no value, you are finished. Finished. Power is with us. Look, outwardly he was a Muslim, but look at his belief. This was his belief. And even today, you think, meaning, think a little. Even today, Muslims say, "No, we should respect him." Think about it a little. As soon as he said that, **فَقَالَ الْحُسَیْنُ بْنُ عَلِیٍّ عَلَیْہِمَا السَّلَامُ** (Then Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them, said,) Immediately Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, what did he say? The Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) is still alive, isn't he? Imam Hasan al-Mujtaba, peace be upon him, is still alive. What would have been Imam Hussain's age at that time? Barely 22 years, meaning, let's say 21 years. From 3 AH to 24 AH, only 21 years. What did Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, say to him? He said:

**قَبَّحَ اللّٰہُ شَیْبَتَکَ**
(May Allah make your gray hair ugly)
- [Reference needed]

**وَقَبَّحَ وَجْہَکَ**
(and make your face ugly.)
- [Reference needed]

And then after saying this, the Imam pulled his hand away. And he separated from him. Who was with them there? Nu'man ibn Bashir. The father-in-law of Mukhtar. That's why I am saying father-in-law; people say "sasar" (سسر) is not a good word, in Urdu they say "khusar" (خسر). But here if I say "khusar," etc., I mean father-in-law. Okay? So, Mukhtar's father-in-law, Nu'man ibn Bashir, who was the first wife's father. Nu'man ibn Bashir pulled Abu Sufyan's hand and said, "Come here before Hussain finishes you off." Look how much fear they had. Now, from this incident, we learn that the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them, never lost their awe and majesty. They never bowed to anyone, whether they were in power or not. So, the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them, fully followed the conduct of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, but at the same time, they acted with justice, showing everyone their place where it was due. And this is very necessary. This is very necessary.

Meaning, I would like to narrate an incident to you, but now, because time is short, so, by Allah's will, tomorrow this entire incident. This incident is a bit long, but it is very important for children to know this incident. It is called the Incident of Aqaba. If Allah grants success and life until tomorrow, then tomorrow, by Allah's will, I will narrate this incident to you: in which year this incident occurred, and what happened in it. By Allah's will.

### 7. The Unwavering Devotion of Karbala's Companions: Muslim ibn Awsaja

Today, I want to mention a martyr of Karbala whose name was Muslim ibn Awsaja. You know that Muslim ibn Awsaja was a very old man, very old. And yesterday I mentioned an old man. When Muslim ibn Awsaja was martyred, he was breathing his last. As his life was fading, Habib ibn Mazahir came to him and asked:

**یَا مُسْلِمُ ہَلْ لَکَ مِنَ الْوَصِیَّةِ؟**
(O Muslim, do you have any will?)
- [Reference needed]

So, he said, his breath was leaving, but he pointed towards Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, and said:

**اوصیك بِهذا**
(I advise you concerning this one [Imam Hussain]),
- [Reference needed]

meaning, "I advise you to take care of him." Look at both of them. Muslim was martyred just now, and in a little while, Habib was also going to be martyred. But he was making a will not to forget the Imam.

Do you want to know Muslim's belief? When the night of Ashura came, Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, called all his companions and told everyone who wanted to leave to go. He even addressed Muslim directly and said, "Muslim, you are an old man now, meaning, it's not your age anymore." I am speaking in my own words. "Meaning, you should go, let it be, where will you fight now?" Listen to Muslim's reply. This should be our reply for serving our Imam, for serving our Imam of our time. This should be our reply. Muslim says:

**اَنَحْنُ نُخَلِّيْ عَنْکَ**
(Should we leave you alone?)
- [Reference needed]

"Leave you alone? **وَبِمَا نَعْتَذِرُ اِلَى اللّٰہِ** (And what excuse would we present to Allah) **مَنْ اَدَاءِ حَقِّكَ** (regarding the fulfillment of your right?)" When Allah asks me, "Did you fulfill the right of your Imam of the time or not?" In Dua Nudba, we say, **وَ اَیْدِنَا عَلٰی تَاَدِیَةِ حُقُوْقِہٖ اِلَیْہِ** (And support us, O Lord, in fulfilling his rights to him). This is a sentence from Dua Nudba. Read Dua Nudba every Friday. Muslim says this, Muslim ibn Awsaja:

**لَا وَاللّٰہِ**
(No, by Allah!)
- [Reference needed]

"By Allah, I will not leave you **حَتّٰى اَکْسِرَ فِیْ صُدُوْرِہِمْ رُمْحِیْ** (until I break my spear in their chests), such is his passion. **وَ اَضْرِبُھُمْ بِسَیْفِیْ مَا ثَبَتَ قَائِمُہٗ فِیْ یَدِیْ** (and strike them with my sword as long as its hilt remains firm in my hand)." As long as I have the strength to wield this sword, I will fight them with my sword. **وَ لَا اُفَارِقُکَ** (and I will not leave you) for even a moment. For even a moment. **وَ لَوْ لَمْ یَکُنْ مَعِیَ سِلَاحٌ** (and even if I have no weapon) with which I can fight, then **لَقَذَفْتُھُمْ بِالْحِجَارَةِ** (I would certainly throw stones at them.) I will fight with stones. I will keep fighting with stones. **ثُمَّ لَمْ اُفَارِقْ حَتَّى اَمُوْتَ مَعَكَ** (then I will not leave you until I die with you.)
- [Reference needed]

Now look at the passion. Did we ever talk like this to our Imam of our time? Do we talk like this to our Imam of our time? Think about it. So, this was Muslim ibn Awsaja's statement up to this point.

Now, after this, Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him, says:

**وَ کُنْتَ اَوَّلَ مَنْ شَرٰی نَفْسَہٗ**
(And you were the first to sell your soul),
- [Reference needed]

O Muslim, you were the first among the martyrs of Karbala who gave their life.

**وَ اَوَّلَ شَہِیْدٍ مَنْ شُہَدَاءِ اٰلِ الْقَتْلٰی لِآلِ الْاَحْبَا**
(and the first martyr among the martyrs of the Holy Household's killed ones.)
- [Reference needed]

And among the martyrs of Karbala, you were the first martyr who sacrificed his life.

**فَفُزْتَ وَ رَبِّ الْکَعْبَةِ**
(So you have triumphed, by the Lord of the Kaaba!)
- [Reference needed]

Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him, says. And after that, he says:

**شَکَرَ اللّٰہُ اِسْتِقْدَامَکَ وَ مُوَاسَاتَكَ اِمَامَكَ**
(May Allah reward your courage and your support for your Imam.)
- [Reference needed]

May Allah have mercy on you, O Muslim ibn Awsaja. These were the words of Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him. Imam, this narration I just cited to you, it is in *Bihar al-Anwar*, Volume 98. This is the complete *Ziyarat* of Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him, in which the Imam named each and every martyr. He took their names one by one, which shows that the Imam knew the name of every single martyr in Karbala. So yesterday, I mentioned Anas ibn Harith al-Asadi, and today, Muslim ibn Awsaja. Now, you think, I am presenting this to you so that when these companions of the Imam, who were not from his direct family, had such passion to sacrifice themselves for the Imam, then imagine what passion the Imam's own son would have had.

### 8. The Sacrifice of Ali al-Akbar (AS)

Just understand this: As soon as the Imam said, **تَقَدَّمْ یَا بُنَیَّہْ** (Go forth, O my son,) "Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, now you move forward. Now go to fight." Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, immediately came forward. "Father, I am ready." He said, "Son, first go to the tent and ask for permission." Now Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, came to the tent to ask permission from his mother. His mother said, "Ask permission from Auntie (Lady Zainab, peace be upon her), who raised you for 18 years." Now he came to Lady Zainab, peace be upon her, to ask for permission. Lady Zainab, peace be upon her, looked at Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, from head to toe and said, "Son, I raised you for 18 years for this, so that you would ask permission for death?" Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, said, "Auntie, if you don't give permission, it's fine, but what if Grandma asks on the Day of Judgment, 'Did Zainab give permission?'" Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, came. Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, prepared Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, adorned him. Before mounting him on the horse, he said:

**اللَّهُمَّ اشْهَدْ عَلَى هَؤُلَاءِ الْقَوْمِ**
(O Allah, bear witness against these people,)
- [Reference needed]

**قَدْ بَرَزَ إِلَيْهِمْ غُلَامٌ**
(for indeed a young man has gone forth to them,)
- [Reference needed]

**اَشْبَهُ النَّاسِ خَلْقًا وَ خُلُقًا وَ مَنْطِقًا إِلَى نَبِيِّكَ**
(who is the most similar of people in creation, character, and speech to Your Prophet.)
- [Reference needed]

Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, was the spitting image of the Prophet. "When we wanted to see Your Prophet, we would look at Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him." Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, bade him farewell. Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, began to leave. He hadn't gone far when he felt a tug. When Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, turned back, what did he see but his elderly father, with his hand on his back. "O Ali! O Ali!" "Father, you had already bid me farewell, why are you coming back now?" He said, "Son, if you were a father yourself..." If you have seen, surely some individuals have lost their young sons. Surely, you must have seen them. They can bear the greatest calamities of the world, but bearing the grief of a young son is very difficult. Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, bid him farewell. Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, went. He fought, he kept fighting, he sent 120 wicked ones to hell, and then he returned. But in what state did he return?

His mother had a heart. She once told Fizza, "Fizza, go to the tent door. See if my Master's face changes color; then understand that my son is in great distress." Fizza stood at the tent door, looking at Imam Hussain, peace be upon him. Suddenly, she said, "My Lady, my Master's face has changed color!" She said, "My Master, please come." Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, came. "How did you remember me?" She said, "My Master, why has the color of your face changed?" He said, "What can I do? A renowned warrior has come to fight my son. He is well-fed and well-hydrated, and my son has been hungry and thirsty for three days." That was all Umm Layla, peace be upon her, had to hear. She said, "My Master, what should I do?" He said, "Pray. A mother's prayer for her son is accepted." Umm Layla, peace be upon her, made a circle and said, "My ladies, I will pray, and you say Ameen. O You who reunited Yusuf with Yaqub! O Allah, by the sanctity of Hussain, peace be upon him, I implore You, by the helplessness of Hussain, peace be upon him, bring my Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, back!" Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, returned, but in what condition? He was covered in wounds, bleeding, drenched in blood. He came and said:

**یا اَبَتِ الْعَطْشُ قَدْ قَتَلَنِیْ**
(O my father, thirst has killed me!)
- [Reference needed]

**وَحِدَّةُ الْحَدِیْدِ قَدْ اَجْهَدَنِیْ**
(And the sharpness of iron has exhausted me.)

"I can no longer lift the weight of the sword, I can no longer bear the weight of the armor.

**هَلْ إِلٰی شُرْبَةٍ مِّنْ مَاءٍ سَبِیلٌ**
(Is there any way to a drink of water?)"
- [Reference needed]

It was as if Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, said, "Son, you know that there is not a drop of water in this desert. But bring your tongue; put it in my mouth." **هات لسانک** (Give me your tongue.) As soon as Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, put his tongue in, he pulled it back and said, "Father, your tongue is full of thorns!" "Now go, my son, now go! Now your great ancestor will quench your thirst from the fountain of Kawthar." Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, went and fought with great bravery and valor, until suddenly the wicked surrounded Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him. One wicked man aimed at Ali al-Akbar's chest and plunged a spear into it, and that spear pierced Ali al-Akbar's chest. Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, fell from his horse and came among the wicked. The wicked began to hack Ali al-Akbar's body into pieces.

**فَقَطَّعُوْہُ بِسُیُوْفِہِمْ إِرْبًا إِرْبًا**
(So they cut him into pieces with their swords.)
- [Reference needed]

They began to cut Ali al-Akbar's body into pieces. Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon him, cried out, "Father, my last farewell!" Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, rushed to the battlefield, like a raging lion. He pushed the wicked away. It was a matter of his young son. Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, laid Ali al-Akbar's head on his lap, pulled out the spearhead, and a fountain of blood gushed forth. Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, recited a lament:

**یَا بُنَیَّ عَلَى الدُّنْيَا بَعْدَكَ الْعَفَا**
(O my son, after you, let there be naught for this world.)

| **Take to forgiveness (Al-Afw)** | Make pardoning a lifelong principle, release past mistakes, and engage gently with others, continually improving oneself rather than focusing on others' wrongdoings. |
| **Enjoin what is right (Al-Urf)** | Actively promote good actions as defined by sound intellect (*ma'roof*), which encompasses truthfulness and trustworthiness, not just ritualistic practices. |
| **Turn away from the ignorant (Al-Jahilin)** | Avoid unnecessary arguments (*Miraa*) and futile debates, even when in the right, as such engagements bring no benefit and prevent productive discourse. |
| **Practice What You Preach (Amal)** | Words and preaching are ineffective without corresponding actions; one's life must embody the message to have a real impact and draw people to truth. |
| **Imamate as Divine Guidance** | The role of the Imams (AS) transcends worldly government; they are divine administrators who guide humanity in all situations, their authority stemming from Allah's unseen knowledge. |
| **Connecting with the Imam (Ziyarat Jamia)** | Constantly maintain a spiritual connection with the Imam of the time, as access to divine guidance and benefit comes from seeking them out, like visiting the Kaaba. |
| **Wilayah vs. Rituals** | The fundamental belief in Wilayah (guardianship) of the Ahlul Bayt (AS) is distinct from, and must not be overshadowed by, ritualistic acts like prayer and fasting, though these actions are crucial for maintaining one's connection to Wilayah. |
| **Value of Weeping for Imam Hussain (AS)** | Expressing sorrow for Imam Hussain (AS) is profoundly beneficial, capable of increasing worldly sustenance and lifespan, and even serving as a means for divine guidance for all, irrespective of faith. |
| **Justice (*Adl*) in Conduct** | Justice entails placing everything in its rightful position, which includes recognizing and maintaining the awe and majesty of the Ahlul Bayt (AS) and confronting falsehood with firmness when necessary, irrespective of their apparent worldly power. |
| **True Devotion to the Imam** | Exemplified by companions like Muslim ibn Awsaja, true devotion entails an unwavering commitment to the Imam, a readiness to sacrifice everything, and a deep sense of responsibility to fulfill their rights, even in the face of death. |
