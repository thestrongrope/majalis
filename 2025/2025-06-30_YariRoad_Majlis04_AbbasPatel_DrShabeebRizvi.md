### Introduction: The Essence of True Worship

The discourse for this gathering is derived from a noble hadith. Our Master and Chief, Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them, uttered a profound statement that forms the basis of our discussion today.

#### The Hadith of Imam Husayn (a.s.) on True Worship

Our Master and Chief, Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them, said:

"من عبد الله حق عبادته اتاه الله فوق امانيه وكفايته"
"Whoever worships Allah as He ought to be worshipped, Allah will grant him more than his desires and sufficient for his needs."
- [Reference needed]

This means, whoever worships Allah in a manner that truly fulfills the right of worship, Allah will give him more than his aspirations and more than his needs.

The previous discourse revolved around the concept of Imamate. It was stated that the meaning of true worship is worship accompanied by knowledge and recognition (Ma'rifat). Until a person possesses knowledge, their worship has no meaning, no concept, and no benefit if they do not recognize the One they are worshipping. For knowledge, it is necessary to recognize the door that Allah has made through which one should enter; that is, to recognize the Imam of the time, to recognize the Twelve Imams whose obedience has been made obligatory upon us. The circumstances changed in this manner after the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family.

### The Significance of Wilayah (Guardianship)

When we present the argument that, for instance, so many verses and narrations exist regarding the guardianship (Wilayah) of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, we find a substantial body of evidence.

#### Scriptural Evidence for Wilayah

There are many verses in the Quran, almost more than 500 or 600 verses, that specifically speak about guardianship. Similarly, there are many narrations and Hadiths. During the life of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, he repeatedly introduced the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, stating that after him, this is his successor and his Caliph. Finally, upon reaching Ghadir Khumm, he also stated that the guardianship of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, is the religion, and the religion is the guardianship of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him. By reciting the verse:

"اليوم اكملت لكم دينكم واتممت عليكم نعمتی ورضيت لكم الاسلام دينا"
"Today I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:3]

The Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, indicated that a religion without the guardianship (Wilayah) of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, is not a religion. Therefore, this guardianship holds great importance.

#### Disobedience to Prophetic Command

But the question arises: when the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, introduced it so many times, why did people not obey him? The answer to this question is present in both the Quran and narrations. There are many verses in the Quran; we will present just two or three verses to you that will clarify the matter completely.

In the Holy Quran, it is said:

"ما يقال لك الا ما قد قيل الرسل من قبلک"
"Nothing is said to you except what has already been said to the messengers before you."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Fussilat 41:43]

O Prophet, these people who are speaking to you, all these absurd things they are saying, those around you—these are not just things said to you. All the messengers who came before you, their people spoke to them in this manner. Meaning, their people all spoke in this manner. So, "ما يقال لك" (what is said to you), meaning what is being said to you, "الا ما قد قيل الرسل من قبلک" (except what has already been said to the messengers before you), meaning nothing else is being said. In Arabic, when *ma* and *illa* appear together, they are used for exclusivity, meaning only that. So, exactly what previous nations did, this community (Ummah) will also do; there is no difference in it.

In the second verse, it is stated:

"و ان يكذبوا فقد كذبت رسل من قبلک"
"And if they deny you, [they have denied] messengers before you as well."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Al-An'am 6:34]

If they are denying you, disbelieving you, then all the messengers who came before you were also denied. This issue of the majority of this community has always been like this; it's not the first time. Their job is to deny; their job is to reject. So the Quran is clearly saying this in plain words. But when such verses are recited, people say, "No, this is about the polytheists in Mecca who did not believe in the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. It's about the people of Mecca, not about Medina. In Medina, there were Muslims and Companions, etc." If you study those verses as well, it will become absolutely clear to you.

For example, in Surah Aal-e-Imran, verse number 144, it is stated:

"و ما محمد الا رسول"
"And Muhammad is not but a messenger."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Aal-e-Imran 3:144]

"و ما محمد الا رسول قد خلت من قبلهم الرسل"
"And Muhammad is not but a messenger. Verily, [many] messengers have passed away before him."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Aal-e-Imran 3:144]

Before him, many prophets came; they have passed away. `Qad khalat` means 'have passed away,' `min qablihim al-rusul` (before them the messengers).

"افان مات او قتل انقلبتم على اعقابكم"
"So if he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels?"
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Aal-e-Imran 3:144]

Will you turn on your heels and flee? Will you abandon the Messenger, peace be upon him and his holy family, and the religion and leave? "انقلبتم على اعقابكم" (you turned back on your heels).

"ومن ينقلب على عقبيه فلن يضر الله شيئا"
"And whoever turns back on his heels will not harm Allah at all."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Aal-e-Imran 3:144]

And whoever turns away, whoever turns his back, whoever turns his face away, whoever turns his back and leaves, he will not harm Allah at all; never will he harm Allah at all. "فلن يضر الله شيئا" (he will not harm Allah at all).

"و سيجزی الله الشاكرين"
"And Allah will reward the grateful."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Aal-e-Imran 3:144]

Meaning, those who stand with the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, Allah will reward them. And those who turn away, who turn their backs on the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, they will receive their punishment, and they will be counted among the enemies of the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, and among the enemies of Islam. But they do not harm the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, nor do they harm the religion.

There are many such verses that do not translate this way. If you study the verses, you will find it clearly. The Quran has stated repeatedly to the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family – meaning, in Surah At-Tawbah, it is also mentioned that all those around you are hypocrites. These around you, referring to the people of hypocrisy. Look at the verses of Surah At-Tawbah, the verses of Surah Al-Munafiqun. Read them all; you will see in what kind of environment the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, was living. So, the circumstances all around were such that there was no one with the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, except for a few individuals; one could count them on fingers. There were many in name, but those with true faith were very few.

### Parallels Between Nations: Lessons from the Children of Israel

#### The Prophetic Narration on Ummah's Destiny

For example, this is a famous Hadith of the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family:

"يقول في هذا الامة"
"He says concerning this nation."
- [Reference needed]

The Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, prophesied beforehand, that everything in this nation (Ummah) will be the same as "كل من كان فی بنی اسرائیل" (everything that happened among the Children of Israel); whatever happened among the Children of Israel will happen in this nation. This Hadith is not only in Shia books; both factions have narrated it. It is a very well-known and famous Hadith. Exactly what the Children of Israel did will happen here in this Muslim community:

"حذو النعل بالنعل وحذو القذہ بالقذہ"
"like one shoe matching another, and like one feather matching another."
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, wherever the Children of Israel stepped, this community (Ummah) will step there, and wherever their arrow flew, this community's arrow will follow that same arrow. This is called "حذو النعل بالنعل والقذہ بالقذہ" (like one shoe matching another, and like one feather matching another). Meaning, exactly what happened. Now you can read the entire history of the Children of Israel; the complete history of the Children of Israel is available before you.

#### The Story of Samiri and the Golden Calf

Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, went away for only a few days, just 40 days, and what did they do? They prepared a calf (`Gawala-e Qaf`) and worshipped it. And who was the one who prepared it? It was Samiri. After preparing it, he said:

"هذا الهکم"
"This is your god."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Ta-Ha 20:97]

This is your god, it is our god, it is Moses' god, it is everyone's god; this is the goat's child. And this calf, Samiri, with the power he possessed, just to deceive those people, he made the calf produce a sound, the sound that a cow makes. That calf, he himself had prepared it. It wasn't a natural calf; he had prepared it.

Now, how did this sound come? How was this man-made animal producing sound? When Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, asked Samiri how he did this, he said, "I saw that Samiri was very close to Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, very close at one time. What did he see? He saw that Gabriel, peace be upon him, was accompanying Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, on his horse. So Gabriel, peace be upon him – he understood that, for example, this is an angel of Allah, and if this is an angel of Allah, then the horse he is riding must also be a celestial horse. So now, if it's a celestial horse, there must definitely be some miracles in the dust that comes under its hooves."

#### The Miraculous Dust and its Implications

So there is a verse in the Quran:

"فقبضت قبضة من اثر الرسول"
"So I took a handful [of dust] from the footprint of the Messenger."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Ta-Ha 20:96]

`Rasool` here refers to Gabriel, meaning Gabriel. From the footprints left by his horse's hooves, I took. He took a handful of dust; he did not take it from Gabriel's body, nor from Prophet Moses', peace be upon him, body. The dust that was under the hooves of the horse on which Gabriel, peace be upon him, was, Samiri carefully kept that dust. And when he prepared this calf, he blew on it, and the calf began to make sounds.

Now, all Muslims recite this verse with enthusiasm, but no one asks how this dust gained so much power that it made an inanimate object alive, that it started to speak. So think, when we say that this knowledge is attributed to Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, and all these things are attributed to Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, then Gabriel, peace be upon him, who is a servant of Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family), peace be upon them... Rather, it is found in narrations that:

"ملائکہ خدام و شیعتکم"
"angels are servants to your Shia."
- [Reference needed]

Angels are servants of your Shia. So, when the dust under the hoof of the horse of a servant of the Shia of Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family), peace be upon them, has such an effect, then why are you surprised if the `Dhu al-Janah` (the horse of Imam Husayn), peace be upon him, that we bring out in the name of Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, bestows blessings? Then go and object to the Quran.

#### Post-Prophet Events: The Analogy Applied

This is the situation of Muslims; we read, but the obvious thing is not seen. The obvious thing is not visible to them, that this is written in the Quran, this is a miracle of the Quran. And when the same thing is happening in the Muslim community (Ummah), they object to it. They object to everything, asking "why is this?" and "why is that?" So, friend, we saw what happened with the Children of Israel: there was a Samiri and a calf. Why did Samiri prepare the calf? Did he love that baby cow? No, he was using the calf as a pretext, so that by using it, he could later come to power. Once I brought it, then I would automatically come to power.

The same thing happened to Islam. The Prophet's, peace be upon him and his holy family, gasps had not even ceased; he had not even been shrouded when all the Muslims abandoned his body and left. Here, the holy body of the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, lay, and all the Muslims were busy in Saqifah. You read the books, read them, and ask the question: "Why did this happen?"

Now, when people read and wrote books, they understood that this matter is very grave; it is a very complex issue, and things could get stuck here. So now, what did they do? They justified it. There's a proverb in Persian that says: "عذر گناہ بدتر از گناہ است" (The excuse for a sin is worse than the sin itself). The excuse for a sin, that excuse, is worse than the sin.

So now they said that this is a problem, so what did they say? They said that all these people, who were lovers of the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, left his body and went to Saqifah and were appointing a Caliph because appointing a Caliph was more important than the Prophet's shroud and burial, more important than his funeral rites, so that there would be no dispersion or problems in the community (Ummah). The answer to this is very simple: these Companions, sir, they reached Saqifah, and they understood that selecting an Imam was more important than the Prophet's funeral and burial rites, so that there would be no dispersion in the community (Ummah). Did the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, not understand that there should be an Imam after him so that there would be no dispersion in the community (Ummah)? This is a very fundamental point, a very basic intellect. One doesn't need to be a great rocket scientist for this; it's a very simple thing. So, exactly what happened among the Children of Israel, all those things happened here.

### Understanding Taqiyyah (Dissimulation)

The only thing to keep in mind is that whatever we say, whatever discourse we engage in, it should be a very calm discourse because the Imams, peace be upon them, have taught us something called `Taqiyyah` (dissimulation). This `Taqiyyah` is for saving one's religion, for the survival of the religion. If a person does not practice `Taqiyyah`, then the survival of the religion will be difficult. One must observe and decide where to speak and where not to speak.

#### Imam al-Sadiq's Analogy of Bees Among Birds

Regarding `Taqiyyah`, we present this Hadith for your consideration, for children and youth, so that the matter becomes clear for them. Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, peace be upon him, says:

"Protect your religion."
- [Reference needed]

"فَتَقُواْ عَلَى دِينِكُمْ"
"So guard your religion."
- [Reference needed]

"إِتَّقُواْ عَلَى دِينِكُمْ فَحُجُوهُ بِتَقِيَّةٍ"
"Guard your religion, and veil it with `Taqiyyah`."
- [Reference needed]

Look, protect your religion. Save the religion. And for that, what should you do? Keep it concealed with `Taqiyyah`. That is, not everything is spoken in front of everyone. Not everything is spoken in front of everyone. Why? The Imam, peace be upon him, continues:

"فَإِنَّهُ لَا إِيمَانَ لِمَن لَا تَقِيَّةَ لَهُ"
"For verily, there is no faith for one who has no `Taqiyyah`."
- [Reference needed]

Because one who has no `Taqiyyah` has no faith. They have no faith.

"إِنَّمَا أَنتُمْ فِي النَّاسِ كَنَحْلٍ فِي طَائِرٍ"
"Indeed, you among the people are like bees among birds."
- [Reference needed]

Look, your example among other Muslims is like that of a honeybee among birds. Look what analogy the Imam, peace be upon him, is giving! Your example is like a honeybee among birds.

"لَو أَنَّ الطَّائِرَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي أَجْوَافِ النَّحْلِ"
"If the birds knew what was in the bellies of the bees,"
- [Reference needed]

If the birds knew how much honey is in the belly of this honeybee, what would they do?

"مَا بَقِيَ مِنْهَا شَيْءٌ"
"Nothing would remain of them."
- [Reference needed]

Then nothing would be left of it except that those birds would kill and eat the honeybee.

"إِلَّا أَكَلَتْ"
"except they would eat it."
- [Reference needed]

They would eat it.

Similarly, if the enemies of Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family), peace be upon them, the Nasibis (those who bear enmity towards Ahl al-Bayt), come to know what religion you have in your heart, what knowledge you possess, what teachings of the family of Muhammad, peace be upon him and his holy family, you have, then they will not let you live for a single moment. They will not spare you.

"وَ لَو أَنَّ النَّاسَ عَلِمُوا مَا فِي أَجْوَافِكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تُحِبُّونَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ لَأَكَلُوكُم بِأَلْسِنَتِهِمْ وَ لَذَبَحُوكُم فِي السِّرِّ وَ عَلَانِيَةٍ"
"And if the people knew what is in your bellies, [that] you love Ahl al-Bayt, they would surely devour you with their tongues and slaughter you secretly and openly."
- [Reference needed]

If people come to know what is in your hearts, what belief, what guardianship (Wilayah), what disavowal (Bara'at), what ideologies you have? If all that becomes known, then how much you love us, Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family), peace be upon them? They will not spare you; they will devour you with their tongues. And secretly and openly, they will destroy you. You will not be able to escape. Therefore, `Taqiyyah` is very essential for the survival of religion.

#### Sheikh Murtada Ansari on the Rulings of Taqiyyah

But remember, I am presenting a very important point to you. Usually, people have misunderstood `Taqiyyah`. That is why one of our very great religious scholars, Sheikh Murtada Ansari, has passed away. He wrote a book, "رسالة التقية" (Treatise on Taqiyyah). Let us tell you, no greater jurist (Faqih) than Sheikh Murtada Ansari has ever been born, neither after him nor before him. Understand this much. He was a very great jurist. He became a high-ranking religious authority (Mujtahid) at the age of 50. In 1216 (Hijri), he was born. And in 1266 (Hijri), he became a Mujtahid, a source of emulation (Marja'). He became the Marja' for the entire world of Shia Islam. And after that, he passed away in 1281 (Hijri). Meaning, he was a very great Marja'. His title is "خاتم الفقهاء" (Seal of the Jurists). Meaning, the seal of the jurists. No greater jurist was ever born than him. He wrote the book "رسالة التقية" (Treatise on Taqiyyah). In it, he says that `Taqiyyah` has five rulings. `Taqiyyah` can be obligatory (Wajib), `Taqiyyah` can be recommended (Mustahabb). `Taqiyyah` can also be forbidden (Haram). `Taqiyyah` is forbidden. And `Taqiyyah` can be disliked (Makruh). And `Taqiyyah` can also be permissible (Mubah). These are his words. I have given you the name of the book. And its page number is 13; I am giving the page number too. You can see it. You can refer to it yourself. Page number 13. "رسالة التقية" (Treatise on Taqiyyah). He writes it very clearly.

#### When Taqiyyah is Forbidden: Preservation of Religion

So when is this `Taqiyyah` forbidden? This is a very important point. `Taqiyyah` becomes forbidden when, if we go to practice `Taqiyyah`, the religion gets destroyed. The religion ends. The religion is lost due to `Taqiyyah`. Our religion, the religion of our progeny, the religion of our children, all get destroyed. We are caught up in `Taqiyyah`. Then it turns out that our progeny, our children, don't even know what guardianship (Wilayah) is. They don't know what disavowal (Bara'at) is. They don't know what disassociation (Tabarra) is called. What mourning for Imam Husayn (Aza'dari) is called. Why we mourn. We just say, "No, no, no, don't do all this. Don't do all this."

#### The Importance of Educating Children

If we don't tell our children, how will they know? Who usurped the right of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him? Who martyred Lady Fatimah Zahra, peace be upon her? Who showered arrows on the funeral of Imam Hasan al-Mujtaba, peace be upon him? Who poisoned Imam Hasan al-Mujtaba, peace be upon him? All these historical facts should be told to our children. And it is necessary to tell them. And for important things, try to tell them even from their books, that would be very good. Very good. Everything is present in our own books. But also familiarize the children with all these things from their books, so that their religion remains protected.

That is why the Master, peace be upon him, says in Nahj al-Balagha:

"أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، دِينُكُمْ، دِينُكُمْ، دِينُكُمْ"
"O people, your religion, your religion, your religion!"
- [Reference needed: Nahj al-Balagha]

O people, protect your religion. Protect your religion. Look, let no such enemy come, let no one do this that they snatch your religion from you. Snatch your religion from you. Yes, a friend of ours was telling us that he, meaning his friend, had some questions. There was no one to answer, so he changed his religion. There was no one to answer. Because usually in the West, this happens a lot, doesn't it? They ask all these questions. They need answers to their questions. When they don't get answers, they say, "No, then I don't believe this." That's why it's necessary for us to tell them all these things.

So the Imam, peace be upon him, says that `Taqiyyah` is very necessary to practice. But where the matter of religion comes, `Taqiyyah` is forbidden. Where the protection of guardianship (Wilayah) comes.

#### Historical Examples Against Absolute Taqiyyah

And look, there is no hidden meaning in this. If people say `Taqiyyah` should be practiced in all circumstances, then if it were in all circumstances, why did the martyrdom of Sayyid al-Shuhada (Imam Husayn), peace be upon him, occur? Why did the martyrdom of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, occur? Did Lady Fatimah Zahra, peace be upon her, deliver a sermon or not? And did she state all matters in that sermon or not? If those people have not read the sermon, then we request them to go and read the sermon. That sermon is 14 or 15 pages long. It's just a 15-page sermon. You can use ChatGPT to translate it and tell your children, "Look, this is it." It's very simple. It's a 15-page sermon. See what the Princess (Lady Fatimah Zahra), peace be upon her, says. Lady Salman's sermon three days after the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. You can see what Lady Salman, peace be upon him, said. After that, you will see that the entire event of Karbala is before you. Imam Muhammad al-Baqir and Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, peace be upon them, gave what kind of instructions:

Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, peace be upon him, says:

"رَحِمَ اللَّهُ عَبْدًا مِّنْكُمْ"
"May Allah have mercy on a servant from among you."
- [Reference needed]

May Allah bestow mercy upon that servant among you who is steadfast upon our guardianship (Wilayah). Glory be to Allah! Who is steadfast upon our `Wilayah`. Our love, our affection, our `Wilayah` – these are very necessary. If we don't tell these things to our children, then how will it be?

### The Unconditional Obligation of Wilayah

Look, I will now present a Hadith that Sheikh Kulayni narrated in `Al-Kafi`. All these things have been written by our scholars. And these are the same scholars who also wrote about `Taqiyyah`. But they also narrate these Hadiths so that the religion remains protected. You see, protecting the religion is very important. Please pay attention to the sentences of the Hadith. We will read the Hadith slowly so that children can understand. See what the full Hadith is.

#### The Story of Iblis and the Rebellious Nation

The Imam, peace be upon him, says:

"لَوْ أَنَّ إِبْلِيسَ سَجَدَ لِلَّهِ عَزَّ ذِكْرُهُ بَعْدَ الْمَعْصِيَةِ وَ تَكَبُّرِهِ عُمْرَ الدُّنْيَا مَا نَفَعَهُ ذَلِكَ وَ لَا تَقَبَّلَ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ مَا لَمْ يَسْجُدْ لِآدَمَ كَمَا أَمَرَهُ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ أَنْ يَسْجُدَ لَهُ"
"If Iblis had prostrated to Allah, Glorified be His mention, after his disobedience and arrogance for the entire age of the world, that would not have benefited him, and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would not have accepted [anything from him] as long as he did not prostrate to Adam as Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, commanded him to prostrate to him."
- [Reference needed: Al-Kafi, Vol. 1, p. 187, Hadith 2]

If Iblis had continued to worship for the entire age of the universe, after his sin—the sin of not prostrating to Adam—Allah would not have accepted any of his worship. It would not have benefited him, it would have been useless. "مَا لَمْ يَسْجُدْ" (as long as he did not prostrate). Why? He did not prostrate to Adam as Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, had commanded him to prostrate to Adam.

#### Prostration to Other Than Allah in the Quran

Now, before proceeding with the Hadith, let's give another reminder for children and youth. In the Quran, in at least three places, it is commanded to prostrate to others besides Allah. Not prostration to Allah.

##### Prostration to Adam (a.s.)

Firstly, when Allah told the angels to prostrate to Adam. Was Adam God? Adam was not God. If he were God? No. The angels should have said, "O Cherisher, polytheism (shirk)!" `Astaghfirullah` (I seek forgiveness from Allah). "What kind of God are You? You are commanding `shirk`!" But all the angels went into prostration. In fact, the one who did not prostrate was given the title of Satan.

##### Prostration to Prophet Yusuf (a.s.)

This is one example. Secondly, another example from the Quran itself. Prophet Joseph, peace be upon him, said—these are the opening verses of Surah Yusuf—"O my father." He was saying it to his own father, Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him.

"إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ أَحَدَ عَشَرَ كَوْكَبًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ لِي سَاجِدِينَ"
"Indeed, I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Yusuf 12:4]

Father, I saw that 11 stars and the moon and the sun were prostrating to me. I saw this in a dream. Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him, was a very great prophet. Israel, you know, Israel. The name Israel, everyone remembers it now, right? This Israel was the name of Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him. `Israel` means 'servant'. And `il` means 'God'. So, 'servant of Allah'. When `Abdullah` (servant of Allah) is translated into Hebrew, it is called `Israel`. `Israel`. Now Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him, was a tremendous servant. That's why Allah gave him this title, Israel. Who can know the servitude of Allah better than Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him? Yes. But when a small child is saying, "O my father, "إِنِّي رَأَيْتُ أَحَدَ عَشَرَ كَوْكَبًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ لِي سَاجِدِينَ" (Indeed, I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me)." I saw 11 stars and the moon and the sun, all prostrating to me. Immediately, Prophet Israel, Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him, should have said, "Son, this is polytheism (`shirk`). What kind of dream have you seen? This is a bad thing. Don't speak like this." The point is, Prophet Joseph, peace be upon him, was just a child, wasn't he? Oh, it's a child's dream. But Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him, did not say this. These are the verses of Surah Yusuf, carrying this meaning. You can read them. Surah Yusuf, Chapter 12 of the Quran.

What did Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him, say?

"يَا بُنَيَّ لَا تَقْصُصْ رُؤْيَاكَ عَلَى إِخْوَتِكَ فَيَكِيدُوا لَكَ كَيْدًا إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لِلْإِنْسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ"
"O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers, lest they concoct a plot against you. Indeed, Satan is to man a clear enemy."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Yusuf 12:5]

O my son, look, don't tell this dream to your brothers. Keep it to yourself. Don't tell it to anyone. "لَا تَقْصُصْ رُؤْيَاكَ عَلَى إِخْوَتِكَ" (Do not relate your vision to your brothers). Don't tell your brothers. "فَيَكِيدُوا لَكَ كَيْدًا" (lest they concoct a plot against you). Otherwise, they will plot against you. Why? "إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لِلْإِنْسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ" (Indeed, Satan is to man a clear enemy). Because Satan is a clear enemy to humans. Satan's constant ploy is to always make people fight among themselves. Now, whenever you see someone doing this work – making brother fight brother, friend fight friend, tribe fight tribe. Wherever you see this nature, this movement, understand that this person is guiding towards Satan. This is Satan's agent. He is advocating for him. He is making people fight among themselves. And whenever someone brings up such a matter, immediately stop them. Brother, stop ruining yourself and tell me. Remember that Satan also does not work directly. Because he is also a great master. In fact, he is the master of all. He is everyone's teacher. He does not work directly. What does he do? He knows that if he goes through this person, the message will be heard. So sometimes he comes through parents, sometimes through siblings, sometimes through wives and children, sometimes through relatives, sometimes through friends. He knows all these things like that. So Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him, is telling his son, "Son, look, beware of Satan. Don't tell this to anyone." This is `Taqiyyah`. This is the `Taqiyyah` that Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him, is telling his son.

Now when Prophet Joseph, peace be upon him, became the Aziz of Egypt and his parents and brothers came, as soon as they came before him, Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him, his wife, and all his children prostrated before Joseph, peace be upon him. Meaning, he is a Prophet. A Prophet of Allah. Didn't they know that prostrating to someone other than Allah is polytheism (`shirk`)? So, it became known that, well, only what Shias do is polytheism (`shirk`); everything else is permissible. Meaning, a Prophet of Allah. So, Prophet Joseph, peace be upon him, now whose turn is it here? It's Prophet Joseph's turn. Now Prophet Joseph, peace be upon him, is not saying, "Father, what are you doing? This is wrong." Why? Because Prophet Joseph, peace be upon him, knows that Jacob, peace be upon him, is not prostrating on his own. Rather, they are prostrating by Allah's command. And Allah, Jacob, peace be upon him, told his wife, his family, and his children to prostrate to Joseph, peace be upon him. So everyone prostrated. Now it's Joseph's turn. Now Joseph, peace be upon him, does not say, "Father, what are you doing? Don't embarrass me. Don't prostrate here." Rather, Joseph says—these are the words of the Quran:

"هَٰذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُؤْيَايَ مِنْ قَبْلُ"
"This is the interpretation of my dream of before."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Yusuf 12:100]

Father, this is the same dream I saw in my childhood. That was also the same, and this is also the same.

##### Prostration at Bab al-Hittah (Gate of Repentance)

Thirdly, the third example is from the Quran. The Quran says, "We told the Children of Israel." The Children of Israel. All these, the Jews, we told them. That this is `Bab al-Hittah` (the Gate of Repentance); enter it.

"ادْخُلُوا الْبَابَ سُجَّدًا"
"Enter the gate prostrating."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:58]

You, on the Quran, so you enter this gate. This is the gate of the city. Enter it.

"وَ قُولُوا حِطَّةٌ"
"And say, 'Hittah!'"
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:58]

And you keep saying `Hittah`. `Hittah`. If you do these two things. What was the first thing? Prostration. What remembrance (`Dhikr`) should be done in prostration? `Hittah`. Just say `Hittah`.

"نَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطَايَاكُمْ"
"We will forgive you your sins."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:58]

This gate was called `Bab al-Hittah`. The gate of `Hittah`. What does `Hittah` mean? The one that causes all sins to fall away. It is written in our exegesis that Allah gave the command for this reason—this is our exegesis. Now, whoever wants to believe, let them believe. It's the exegesis of our Imams, peace be upon them, brother. It's the exegesis of Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family), peace be upon them. It's the exegesis of Thaqalayn. Whoever wants to believe, let them believe; whoever doesn't want to believe, those who believe in personal opinion (Ahl al-Ra'y), analogy (Ahl al-Qiyas), and innovation (Ahl al-Bid'ah), let them believe that. What are we to do? We follow the exegesis of Thaqalayn. So they, it is written in it that on that gate, on `Bab al-Hittah`, it was written: "يا محمد يا علي" (O Muhammad! O Ali!). "يا حيدري. يا علي" (O Haydari! O Ali!). For that, it was said: Go by prostrating. Prostrate. "يا محمد يا علي" (O Muhammad! O Ali!). Prostrate here and keep saying `Hittah`, `Hittah`. All your sins will be forgiven.

#### The Divine Status of Ahl al-Bayt (a.s.)

Now here's a question. Glory be to Allah! We presented these three examples for your consideration. Look, nobody says—nobody. If someone says it, they are at least not a Muslim; they are outside the fold of religion. That they should call Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family) God. If anyone calls Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family) God and attributes divinity, Lordship, and godhood to them, that person is not a Shia. They are outside the fold of religion. Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family) are servants of Allah.

##### Ahl al-Bayt are not God, but are Unique Creations

But the servants of Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family)—the Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family) are servants of Allah—this does not mean that Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family) are servants of Allah in the same way we are. There is a world of difference between these two. A world of difference. The Master of Existence, peace be upon him, says:

"نَحْنُ صَنَائِعُ رَبِّنَا وَ الْخَلْقُ بَعْدَ صَنَائِعُنَا"
"We are the creations of our Lord, and the creation after that is our creation."
- [Reference needed: Nahj al-Balagha, possibly a quote attributed to Imam Ali or other Imams]

It is in Nahj al-Balagha. He means that we are the creatures of Allah. Allah created us. After that, we created all creatures. We created them. Glory be to Allah! My Nahj al-Balagha mentions: "الخلق بعد..." (And the creation after that...). So, considering Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family) as God is a major sin, polytheism (`shirk`). It is `shirk`. Therefore, do not do anything that might lead to the accusation that people believe Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family) are God. This is...

But after that, the Imams, peace be upon them, themselves say:

"نَزِّلُونَا عَنِ الرُّبُوبِيَّةِ وَقُولُوا فِينَا مَا شِئْتُمْ لَنْ تَنَالُونَا"
"Lower us from Lordship, and say what you wish about us; you will never reach us."
- [Reference needed]

So, just don't call us God. After that, recite as many virtues about us as you want; you will never reach us. Glory be to Allah! Glory be to Allah! You will never be able to reach. No matter how much, just don't say God; just say servant, say creation of Allah. You can never reach.

And that is why, when the Master of Existence—look, there's a scholar. This is a verse by Shafi'i. Shafi'i says—you know Imam Shafi'i, they say, Imam Shafi'i, "أعلى الله مقامه" (May Allah elevate his status). Imam Shafi'i. What is this? He is reciting it with great emphasis.

"قَالَ لِي أَمْرُ قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِنْ قُلْتُ لَهُ بَشَرٌ فَالْعَقْلُ يَمْنَعُنِي وَأَخْشَى اللَّهَ إِنْ قُلْتُ هُوَ اللَّهُ"
"He said to me a matter, I said to them, 'If I say he is a human, then intellect prevents me, and I fear Allah if I say he is Allah.'"
- [Reference needed: Attributed to Imam Shafi'i regarding Imam Ali]

Look, this is a verse of Imam Shafi'i: "They tell me to praise Ali." I tell them, "If I say that Ali—if I say, "إِنْ قُلْتُ لَهُ بَشَرٌ فَالْعَقْلُ يَمْنَعُنِي" (If I say he is a human, then intellect prevents me)." If I say that the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, is human, then intellect says, "No, a human cannot be like that." Intellect says that an ordinary human cannot be like that. "وَأَخْشَى اللَّهَ إِنْ قُلْتُ هُوَ اللَّهُ" (And I fear Allah if I say he is Allah). And I fear Allah from saying that the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, is Allah. Glory be to Allah!

Now, we are giving you examples for this reason: why did people get scared in history? We will talk about history. And let's go further.

##### Angels Learned from Ahl al-Bayt

In the dominion, Allah created angels. All Muslims believe that angels are infallible. All Muslims. Is there any Muslim who does not believe angels are infallible? All Muslims, angels are infallible. And they do only what Allah commands. Now, see what is written in narrations. That when Allah created the angels, when they saw the Light of the family of Muhammad, peace be upon him and his holy family, they were so bewildered, meaning they thought that this was God. Upon seeing the Light of the family of Muhammad, peace be upon him and his holy family.

So the Master, peace be upon them, says that when we saw that such a thought was coming into the angels:

"فَسَبَّحْنَا"
"So we glorified [Allah]."
- [Reference needed]

"فَسَبَّحَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ"
"Then the angels glorified [Allah]."
- [Reference needed]

We began glorifying Allah, and then the angels also began glorifying Allah, and the angels understood that we are not God. Then, when they came to the second stage, the angels saw such a great light again in the second stage as well. So the angels were further bewildered, then we said:

"حَلَّلْنَا"
"We said 'La ilaha illa Allah'."
- [Reference needed]

"وَ حَلَّلَتِ الْمَلَائِكَةُ"
"And the angels said 'La ilaha illa Allah'."
- [Reference needed]

We said "لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ" (There is no god but Allah). The angels understood that Allah is separate, and we are separate. And then the angels also said "لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ" (There is no god but Allah). And in this way, the angels learned glorification and declaration of oneness from Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family), peace be upon them. They learned from Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family), peace be upon them.

##### The Hadith of Light and its Significance

Now look, ponder over this matter. Mir Hamid Husayn Hindi, "رضوان الله تعالى عليه" (May Allah, the Exalted, be pleased with him). You know the author of Abaqat al-Anwar, who wrote it. He did a great work; Abaqat al-Anwar is nothing short of a miracle. Pray that its complete English translation becomes publicly available, "إن شاء الله تعالى" (if Allah, the Exalted, wills). So all children can read it. Please pray, "إن شاء الله" (if Allah wills). Its translation is underway, please pray. In it, an entire volume is written about the Hadith of Light. The Hadith of Light:

"أَنَا وَعَلِيٌّ مِنْ نُورٍ وَاحِدٍ"
"I and Ali are from one light."
- [Reference needed]

I and Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, are from one light. On this, he cites more than a hundred references from the books of other Muslims—not Shia books, but more than a hundred—to show that this Hadith is authentic. Which we were just presenting to you.

#### Wilayah as an Uninterrupted Obligation

So the Imam, peace be upon them, says that if Iblis had prostrated for the entire life of the world, this prostration would not have benefited him, and Allah would not have accepted his worship. And then he says. Now pay attention to the sentence.

"كَذَلِكَ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةُ الْعَاصِيَةُ وَالْمَفْتُونَةُ بَعْدَ نَبِيِّهَا"
"And similarly, this rebellious and tempted nation after its Prophet."
- [Reference needed: Al-Kafi, Vol. 1, p. 187, Hadith 2]

And similarly, this is the nation. This is the nation. This nation after the Messenger, peace be upon him and his holy family—which nation? The disobedient, "عَاصِيَةٌ" (rebellious), which did not obey its Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, disobeyed. "الْمَفْتُونَةُ" (tempted), which was tested; this nation was tested after its Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family.

"وَبَعْدَ تَرْكِهِمُ الْإِمَامَ الَّذِي نَصَبَهُ نَبِيُّهُمْ لَهُمْ"
"And after their abandoning the Imam whom their Prophet had appointed for them."
- [Reference needed: Al-Kafi, Vol. 1, p. 187, Hadith 2]

When they abandoned that Imam. That Imam, meaning the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, whom Allah and His Messenger, peace be upon him and his holy family, had appointed, they abandoned him.

"فَلَنْ يَقْبَلَ اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى لَهُمْ عَمَلًا وَلَنْ يَرْفَعَ لَهُمْ حَسَنَةً حَتَّى يَأْتُوا اللَّهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ أَمَرَهُمْ"
"So Allah, Blessed and Exalted, will not accept any deed from them. And He will not raise any good deed for them, until they come to Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, from where He commanded them."
- [Reference needed: Al-Kafi, Vol. 1, p. 187, Hadith 2]

Allah will not accept any deed from this nation. Any deed, because they abandoned that Imam whom Allah and His Messenger, peace be upon him and his holy family, had appointed. And none of their good deeds will be accepted; not even a single good deed will be accepted. Until they present their deeds through that Imam whom Allah has appointed. The entire Hadith continues.

##### Exemptions in Other Obligations vs. Wilayah

After that, the Imam, peace be upon them, says:

"وَلَايَتُنَا فَرَخَّصَ لَهُمْ فِي أَشْيَاءَ مِنَ الْفَرَائِضِ الْأَرْبَعَةِ"
"And our guardianship. And meaning, among the things that Allah has made obligatory, one thing He has made obligatory is our `Wilayah` (guardianship), and He has granted them concession in some matters from the four obligatory duties."
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, prayer (Salat), fasting (Sawm), Hajj, Zakat—all these are obligatory duties. But the Imam, peace be upon him, says that Allah has excused them for everyone at some point or another. For example, if a person is very sick, in the hospital, in a very critical condition, unable to pray, they can simply pray by gesturing while lying down. While lying down. Like someone buried under rubble—you understand rubble, right? Buried in debris. So if they are buried underneath, they remained buried in that rubble for three days. When they came out, they said, "For three days, not a single one of my prayers was missed." For three days, I was praying by gesturing. You see, there are such people who pray. And look what happens with us, there are excuses for small things. So, anyway, for prayer, gesturing is sufficient in that situation. Similarly, there is fasting. Fasting has been excused by Allah. Allah has excused fasting. And similarly, for whom is it excused? For someone who is sick, or someone who is on a journey. For women, it is sometimes excused. So, all these are exempted. Similarly, what is the condition for Hajj? One must be capable. If a person has the capability, then they can perform Hajj. Similarly, for Zakat, if one meets the threshold (Nisab), they should pay Zakat, otherwise Zakat is not obligatory for them.

The Imam, peace be upon them, says, "But our guardianship (Wilayah) is that for which there is never any exemption. In every situation—meaning, from the moment a person recognizes Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family), peace be upon them, until their dying breath—if they firmly hold onto the belief in Ahl al-Bayt (the Holy Family), peace be upon them, teach your children `يا علي يا علي` (O Ali! O Ali!)."

##### The Power of Love for Ahl al-Bayt

Then if we teach them to say `Ya Ali` today, the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, will certainly come to their grave. And he will say, "This one is ours; this one is ours." If we teach children to mourn, believe me, Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, will come for their intercession (Shafa'at) in the grave. Believe me. Teach your children:

"لا أعرف إلا صاحب هذه القبة"
"I know no one except the owner of this dome."
- [Reference needed]

I know no one except Imam Husayn, peace be upon him; that's all. I don't know anyone.

##### The Villager of Karbala Incident

It's a famous incident. That man died, and the night in his grave passed very easily. When his family saw him in a dream, they asked, "How was the night?" He said, "It was very easy." They actually didn't see him; they saw a scholar who was buried next to him. So his children said, "Your night was very easy, and you have so much knowledge and so many services, so many books written." He said, "All that was of no use." "Then what happened?" He said that next to me, a villager from near Karbala, who was my fellow villager, had brought and buried him there. So when the angels came, they first went to him. They went to him right there in Karbala, and when they went to him and started asking questions, he was giving the same answer to every question; he was a resident of Karbala.

"لا أعرف إلا صاحب هذه القبة"
"I know no one except the owner of this dome."
- [Reference needed]

I know no one except the owner of the dome, Imam Husayn, peace be upon him; that's all. I don't know anyone. Whatever question they asked, he said, "I don't recognize anyone; I only know them, I know Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them; I don't know anyone else." This is the only answer: "لا أعرف إلا صاحب هذه القبة" (I know no one except the owner of this dome).

So the angels started looking at each other, uncomfortable, thinking, "Brother, he's giving the same answer to everyone." Then, while they were still thinking, a voice came from behind, "Go, let him go. He is ours. He is ours." So that is why the Night of Power, the night of the grave, passed very easily. Very easily. This is a very famous incident, it's about a very great religious scholar, yes. And the one who narrated this incident—meaning, he is also a very great religious scholar, very great. Praise be to Allah that we also have his recording. I mean, video recording, not just audio, so you can't say it's not real. And this is from before AI, yes. So you can watch it; it's very old. It's not like it was made now.

They say that `no`, this is our guardianship (Wilayah).

"وَ لَمْ يُرَخِّصْ لِأَحَدٍ مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ فِي تَرْكِ وِلَايَتِنَا لَا وَاللَّهِ لَا فِيهَا رُخْصَةٌ"
"And He has not permitted any Muslim to abandon our guardianship. No, by Allah, there is no concession in it."
- [Reference needed]

There is no exemption in it, no concession, by God, the Imam, peace be upon them, says, Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, peace be upon him, says.

### The Example of Habib ibn Mazahir

You see the same thing in Karbala, when Sayyid al-Shuhada (Master of Martyrs) Husayn, peace be upon him, reached Karbala, he wrote a letter. To his childhood friend, Habib. Now Habib was sitting at the dining table, about to eat. Suddenly, someone knocked at the door. He asked, "Who is it?" It was said:

"أَنَا بَرِيدُ الْحُسَيْنِ"
"I am the messenger of Husayn."
- [Reference needed]

I am Husayn's messenger. The messenger of my Master. Habib got up, took the letter, opened it, placed it on his eyes, then on his head. It was written on the letter, Habib, the letter began like this:

"بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ"
"In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful."
- [Reference needed: Quran 1:1]

"مِنَ الْحُسَيْنِ ابْنِ عَلِيٍّ إِلَى الرَّجُلِ الْفَقِيهِ حَبِيبِ بْنِ مَظَاهِرٍ الْأَسَدِيِّ"
"From Husayn ibn Ali to the jurisprudent man, Habib ibn Mazahir al-Asadi."
- [Reference needed]

This letter is from Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them. For whom? A jurisprudent man. That jurisprudent, that scholar, that discerning Habib, the letter is for him.

#### Imam Husayn's Letter to Habib

O Habib, if you are not aware of our circumstances, then know that we are surrounded by adversaries. You know what our kinship with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, is. Habib! You are our childhood friend. You are aware of our status and position. We are surrounded by adversaries, Habib. If possible, come to our aid.

#### Habib's Resolve and His Wife's Faith

Habib simply read the letter and sat down. He sat down. His wife asked, "What happened? Whose letter is it?" He said, "It's a letter from my Master, Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them." She asked, "What is written?" He said, "He has called for help; they are surrounded by adversaries. Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them, is surrounded by enemies." She said, "So what are you thinking?" He said, "You know what the situation in Kufa is like. In such circumstances, how can I go to help my Master?" His wife said, "Then you stay at home; I will go to help Fatimah's son (Imam Husayn), peace be upon them."

When Habib had tested his wife, he said, "O believer woman, Fatimah's son calls me for help, and I should not go? I was only testing your heart." Saying this, Habib got up, called his servant, and told him, "This is my steed, this is my horse. Take it and stand at such and such a place, and from there we have to go to help the grandson of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family."

#### The Loyalty of the Steed and the Servant

The servant took the horse and went. He took it and stood there. Habib got ready and set out. He was going through different streets. It took him a little while to arrive, and what did he see? Tears were flowing from the horse's eyes. The servant was explaining. "O, my loyal steed, don't worry. Even if my master Habib does not come, I will take you." To help Fatimah's son (Imam Husayn), peace be upon them. Habib turned around, slapped his face, and said, "Today, such a time has come upon the grandson of the Messenger, peace be upon him and his holy family, that even animals are weeping."

The servant was ready to give his life. Habib mounted the horse, and after mounting, he told the servant, "Go, I have freed you in the way of Allah." I have freed you in the way of Allah. Now the servant said, "Habib, this is not fair. You took my service as long as you needed it. Now, when it's time to serve Fatimah's son (Imam Husayn), peace be upon them, you are leaving me behind. I will also come with you." Habib went, taking the servant with him.

#### The Welcome of Imam Husayn and Lady Zaynab

Now, as they approached Karbala, when dust rose, Husayn, peace be upon him, understood. Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, understood that Habib ibn Mazahir was coming. He said, "Get up, get up, my friends, get up! Go and welcome Habib. My childhood friend Habib is coming; welcome him. My devoted Habib is coming."

Now, when this news gradually reached the tent, Lady Zaynab, peace be upon her, asked Lady Fiddah, peace be upon her, "Fiddah, ever since we left home, only bad news has been coming. What has happened now that waves of joy are spreading?" Fiddah went and inquired at the tent door. She asked there and later came back and informed, "My Lady, the Master's childhood friend, Habib, is coming." As soon as Lady Zaynab, peace be upon her, heard Habib's name, she said, "Fiddah, go and convey our greetings to Habib. Tell Habib that he has done a great deed by coming to our aid." As soon as Fiddah conveyed the greetings, Habib struck his horse on the ground of Karbala and sat down himself. He threw dust on his head, [thinking] "Today, the daughters of the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, are in such a state that they are sending greetings to servants like us."

#### Imam Husayn's Message to the Shia

I will say, "Habib, oh, this is just the beginning of the calamities." Oh, when the Day of Ashura comes, Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, will tell Imam Zayn al-Abidin, peace be upon them, "My son, when you go to Medina, convey our greetings to our Shia." And say:

"شِيعَتِي وَ إِنْ شَرِبْتُمْ عَذْبَ مَاءٍ فَاذْكُرُونِي"
"O my Shia, if you drink sweet water, remember me."
- [Reference needed]

O my beloved ones! Whenever you drink cold water, remember my thirst. And whenever you see someone helpless, remember my helplessness.

"وَسَيَعْلَمُ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا أَيَّ مُنْقَلَبٍ يَنْقَلِبُونَ"
"And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Ash-Shu'ara 26:227]

"أَلَا لَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ"
"Verily, the curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers."
- [Reference needed: Quran, Surah Hud 11:18]

### 📌 Principles and Insights Taught

| Principle Discussed | Concise Summary of Key Point |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| **True Worship (Haqq Ibadah)** | True worship of Allah is intertwined with the recognition (Ma'rifat) of the Imam appointed by Allah, without which worship is incomplete and without benefit. |
| **Significance of Wilayah** | The guardianship (Wilayah) of Ahl al-Bayt is paramount, equating to the perfection of religion, and its abandonment renders deeds unacceptable by Allah. |
| **Historical Parallels (Sunnah al-Awwalin)** | The Muslim Ummah's actions post-Prophet parallel the Children of Israel's disobedience, particularly in abandoning divinely appointed leadership for worldly gains. |
| **The Role of Taqiyyah** | Taqiyyah (dissimulation) is a crucial tool for preserving one's faith and the religion itself in hostile environments, protecting believers from persecution. |
| **Limits of Taqiyyah** | Taqiyyah is forbidden when its practice leads to the destruction or abandonment of fundamental religious principles, especially the Wilayah of Ahl al-Bayt, and the failure to educate future generations about these principles. |
| **Unconditional Wilayah** | Unlike other religious obligations that may have exemptions, belief in and adherence to the Wilayah of Ahl al-Bayt is an uninterrupted, lifelong obligation for which there is no concession. |
| **Divine Status of Ahl al-Bayt** | Ahl al-Bayt are servants of Allah, not divine, yet possess a unique elevated status and light from which even angels learned glorification and monotheism. |
| **Intercession (Shafa'at) through Ahl al-Bayt** | The strong bond and love for Ahl al-Bayt, expressed through practices like mourning and calling upon them, guarantees their intercession and solace in this life and the hereafter. |
| **The Example of Habib ibn Mazahir** | Habib's unwavering loyalty to Imam Husayn in the face of adversity exemplifies the ultimate commitment to Wilayah, even when it demands sacrificing everything. |
