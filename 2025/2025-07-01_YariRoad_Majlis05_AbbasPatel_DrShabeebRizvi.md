## Content

### Introduction: The Essence of Worship and Recognition

The lecture begins with a traditional opening, praising Allah and sending blessings upon the Holy Prophet Muhammad and his pure family.

اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد وعجل فرجهم والعن أعدائهم
(O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance, and curse their enemies).

The speaker then introduces a noble hadith from Imam Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them.

#### The Hadith of Imam Husayn (AS) on True Worship

Our master and leader, Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them, said:
"من عبد الله حق عبادته، آتاه الله فوق أمانيه وكفايته."
(Whoever worships Allah as He truly deserves to be worshipped, Allah will grant him beyond his hopes and sufficiency.)
Our master Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them, spoke the truth.

The essence of this hadith is that if one performs worship as it is truly due to Allah, then Allah will grant that person more than their desires and needs. The critical condition mentioned is performing worship "as it is truly due."

#### The Necessity of Ma'rifat (Gnosis/Recognition) for Worship

The speaker emphasizes that worship is not possible without Ma'rifat (Recognition or Gnosis). Without Ma'rifat, worship yields no result; it is effectively zero. Therefore, Ma'rifat is very necessary. The Master of Martyrs himself highlights this necessity.
In this context, the Ma'rifat being referred to is the Ma'rifat of one's Imam of the time. It is profoundly important to recognize the station of Imamate itself.

### The Deviated Definition of Imamate Post-Prophet (PBUH&HP)

The speaker explains that immediately after the martyrdom of the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, everything changed. People entered the phase described in the Quran as "انقلبتم على أعقابكم" (you turned back on your heels); they were overturned and deviated from the straight path. This deviation resulted in a change in the definition of everything, including the definition of Imamate.

#### Imamate as General Leadership and Governance

The general definition of Imamate that emerged was:
"ان الإمامة هي الرياسة العامة في الدين والدنيا خلافة عن رسول الله"
(Indeed, Imamate is the general leadership in religion and worldly affairs, as a succession to the Messenger of Allah).
Imamate became primarily associated with governance. It meant "general leadership," evolving into a concept where whoever held power became the Imam. Gradually, the religious aspect of this definition disappeared, leaving only worldly affairs. Ultimately, this led to the saying: "نحن مع من غلب" (We are with whoever prevails). This meant that whoever gained dominance or won, whoever had power, was considered the Imam.

#### Consequences of the Deviated Definition

This shift in definition led to the acceptance of individuals as Imams, even if they were transgressors (fasiq) or sinners (fajir), as long as they did not overtly abandon Islam. Even an ignorant person could become an Imam, provided they sought assistance from a scholar to issue fatwas. This changing definition ultimately stripped away the true essence of Imamate, leaving behind only governance, akin to monarchy, where a person becomes a king and ruler with little regard for religious principles.

The speaker points to historical evidence: within merely 40 or 50 years after the Holy Prophet's martyrdom, Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah, لعنة الله عليه (may Allah's curse be upon him), was appointed Caliph of the Muslims, the "Caliph of the Messenger of Allah." This Yazid was a شارب الخمر (drinker of wine), played with monkeys and dogs, and had no distinction between lawful and unlawful, being consumed by pleasure and indulgence.

To legitimize Yazid, hadiths were fabricated, claiming the Holy Prophet had prophesied him as a person of Paradise because he had joined a certain army. While efforts were made to declare him a person of Paradise, history undeniably shows his true character. When all else failed, his proponents even resorted to praising his physical beauty and poetic ability, as if Imamate was determined by such superficial qualities. This was all done to hide the true Imamate from the people.

### The Ahl al-Bayt's (AS) True Definition of Imamate

While this deviation was occurring, the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, continued their work of guiding and leading the people, never stepping back from their responsibility. They formally defined the Imam and explained what Imamate truly is, highlighting the vast difference from the deviated understanding.

اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد وعجل فرجهم
(O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance).

#### Imam Reza's (AS) Definition: Islam's Growing Foundation and Lofty Branch

Imam Reza, peace be upon him, defined Imamate as:
"إن الإمامة اس الإسلام النامي وفرعه السامي"
(Indeed, Imamate is the growing foundation of Islam and its lofty branch).
Imamate is the foundation (اس) of Islam, a foundation that is "growing" (النامي). This means that through Imamate, Islam grows and becomes great. Without Imamate, Islam would not experience growth; it would be dead. History shows that without true Imamate, Islam became stagnant and lifeless.

The Imam also states that Imamate is "its lofty branch" (و فرعه السامي). Among the branches of Islam, such as prayer, fasting, Hajj, zakat, khums, and jihad, Imamate is the highest and most important. This is because if Imamate is not understood or if one does not follow the correct Imam – the one appointed by Allah and introduced by the Holy Prophet – then prayer, fasting, Hajj, khums, and jihad will not be correctly understood or performed.

#### Imamate as the Key to Understanding Islam

The speaker explains that the lack of adherence to the true Imam led to numerous changes in Islam, causing the true Islam of the Holy Prophet's time to be lost. This deviation is why so many sects emerged among Muslims. The Holy Prophet peace be upon him and his holy family prophesied 73 sects among Muslims, compared to 71 among Jews and 72 among Christians. These sects formed because people abandoned the true Imam, each following their own understanding, leading to different practices in prayer, fasting, Hajj, and other aspects of religion.

#### Islam Built Upon Five Pillars, with Wilayat as the Most Important

Narrations emphasize the fundamental importance of Imamate (Wilayat) by stating:
"بني الإسلام على خمسة أشياء"
(Islam is built upon five things):
"الصلاة، والزكاة، والحج، والصوم، والولاية"
(prayer, zakat, hajj, fasting, and wilayat).

#### Wilayat as the Foundation of Both Usul al-Din and Furu al-Din

The speaker highlights a crucial point: Wilayat (and Imamate) belongs to both the principles of religion (Usul al-Din) and the branches of religion (Furu al-Din).
*   **In Usul al-Din**: Through the Imam, true monotheism (tawhid), justice (`adl), prophethood (nubuwwah), Imamate itself, and resurrection (qiyamah/ma`ad) are known. If people do not follow the true Imam, none of these fundamental principles will be correctly understood or practiced.
*   **In Furu al-Din**: Similarly, if there is no true Imam, then neither prayer, nor fasting, nor Hajj, nor khums (which might not even exist), nor zakat, nor jihad will be correct. Even enjoining good (amr bi al-ma'ruf), forbidding evil (nahy `an al-munkar), love (tawalla), and disassociation (tabarra) will not be correctly understood or performed.

The speaker points out the distortion in understanding principles like enjoining good and forbidding evil among those who deviated. They would argue that if a fasiq (transgressor) or fajir (sinner) becomes Imam, he should not be removed; instead, one should merely advise him, for example, "Imam Sahib, please don't drink alcohol," or "Imam Sahib, please don't gamble." This shows how their definition of Imamate reduced it to mere worldly governance with superficial religious advice.

### The Superiority of Wilayat and its Role as a Guide

#### Zurarah's Question and the Imam's Response

Zurarah ibn A'yan, one of the Imam's very special companions, played a pivotal role in preserving true Islam and Shi'ism. The Imams themselves stated that without four specific companions, including Zurarah, Muhammad ibn Muslim, Burayd ibn Ajali, and Abu Basir, "لندرسة آثار النبوة" (the signs of prophethood would have been erased).

The speaker then narrates the remarkable story of Zurarah and his family. Initially, none of Zurarah's six or seven brothers were Shi'a. Their sister, Umm al-Aswad, played a crucial role. She attended the lessons of Abu Khalid Kabuli, a student of Imam Zayn al-Abidin (AS) from Kabul, Afghanistan. Abu Khalid bravely taught what he learned from the Imam despite difficult conditions. Umm al-Aswad recognized the truth and became a Mustabsirah (one who gained insight and converted to Shi'ism). She then convinced her brother Zurarah, who was initially a Jahmi (a follower of a Muslim sect), to attend Abu Khalid's lessons. After some discussion with Abu Khalid, Zurarah became Shi'a. Subsequently, his brothers Hurrat, Ubaydullah, and Bukayr also became Shi'a, with six of them becoming jurists (faqih).

The high status of Zurarah and Hurrat is evident:
اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد وعجل فرجهم
(O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance).
It is mentioned in hadith that on the Day of Judgment, a call will be made: "Where are the companions of Imam Baqir and Imam Sadiq, peace be upon them?" The first two names mentioned will be Zurarah and Hurrat. Regarding Hurrat, the Imam said:
"أَتَرَوْنَ أَنَّكُمْ أَصْحَابُنَا، وَنَحْنُ لَكُمْ مَعْيَارُ الْحَقِّ، مَنْ أَصْبَحَ عَلَى مَا أَصْبَحَ عَلَيْهِ حُرَّاتٌ فَهُوَ عَلَى الْحَقِّ"
(Do you think you are our companions, while we are the standard of truth for you? Whoever wakes up on what Hurrat wakes up on, he is on the truth.)
Hurrat is the standard of truth; if one's belief aligns with Hurrat's, they are a true Shi'a. Sheikh Saduq dedicated an entire chapter to Hurrat's status. This profound transformation in an entire family was due to the will and effort of one woman, Umm al-Aswad. The speaker briefly adds that understanding Karbala in its true essence requires understanding the pivotal role of women there.

Zurarah asked the Imam:
“وَأَيُّ شَيْءٍ مِنْ ذَلِكَ أَفْضَلُ”
(And which of these is superior?), referring to the five foundations of Islam.
The Imam answered:
“الْوَلَايَةُ أَفْضَلُ”
(Wilayat is superior).
Wilayat is superior to prayer, fasting, Hajj, and Jihad. The Imam further explained why:
“لِأَنَّهَا مِفْتَاحُهُنَّ”
(because it is the key to all of them).
Wilayat is the key to all acts of worship, as all acts of worship are correctly known through Imamate.
“وَالْوَالِي” (and the guardian), meaning “وَالْإِمَامُ” (and the Imam), “هُوَ دَلِيلٌ عَلَيْهِنَّ” (he is the guide to them).
The Imam guides and shows how these acts of worship should be performed correctly.

The speaker provides an example to illustrate this point. A companion asked Imam Sadiq (AS):
اللهم صل علی محمد و آل محمد و عجل فرجہم۔
(O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance).
He asked, "What are the similarities and differences between us and the opponents?" The Imam replied that the only similarity is facing the same Qibla, "استقبال الکعبہ" (facing the Kaaba); besides this, there is nothing. The proof is simple: monotheism (Tawhid) was changed, justice (`Adl) was removed from the Usul al-Din.

Regarding prophethood (nubuwwah), the speaker offers an example of how it was distorted: The common narration claims that when Gabriel first came with revelation, the Holy Prophet (PBUH&HP) became frightened, started running, and did not understand. He then returned home, covered himself with a blanket, trembled, and developed a fever. Lady Khadija (AS) then took him to her cousin, Warqa ibn Nawfal, an astrologer (not a Muslim at that time). Warqa supposedly looked at him and declared, "Oh, he has become a prophet!" The speaker questions this, suggesting that if Warqa understood prophethood more, he would be better suited to be a prophet. This demonstrates how the true understanding of prophethood was distorted.

Another example of distortion is in the best practices in Islam regarding the modesty of women. Islam emphasizes that other men should not see the modesty of women. Yet, fabricated narrations formally stated that the Holy Prophet (PBUH&HP) was racing with his wife on his shoulders while companions clapped. The speaker expresses dismay at such portrayals, stating that if this is religion, then it is no religion.

#### The Ahl al-Bayt as the Root of All Good

The speaker emphasizes a very important hadith from Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him, which should be a life principle:
اللهم صل علی محمد و آل محمد و عجل فرجہم۔
(O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance).
The Imam says:
“نَحْنُ أَصْلُ كُلِّ خَيْرٍ”
(We are the root of every good).
All goodness originates from the Ahl al-Bayt.
“وَمِنْ فُرُوعِنَا” (and from our branches) “كُلُّ بِرٍّ” (is every good deed).
All good deeds are the branches of Imamate and originate from the Ahl al-Bayt. Among these branches are:
“وَمِنَ الْبِرِّ التَّوْحِيدُ” (And from good deeds is monotheism), meaning true monotheism, prayer, fasting, and good ethics such as suppressing anger, forgiving, having mercy on the poor, taking care of neighbors, and acknowledging the virtue of those who are truly virtuous. Whatever good deed one can imagine, whether in the principles of religion (Usul al-Din), the branches of religion (Furu al-Din), or ethics, its root is the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them.

#### The Enemies of Ahl al-Bayt as the Root of All Evil

The Imam continues:
“وَعَدُوُّنا أَصْلُ كُلِّ شَرٍّ”
(And our enemies are the root of every evil).
All evils seen in the world originate from the enemies of Ahl al-Bayt. All obscenities and indecencies also stem from them. Among these evils are: lying, stinginess, backbiting, قَتلِ رَحِم (severing ties of kinship), eating usury (ربّا), and unlawfully consuming the orphan's property (مالِ یتیم).

##### The Issue of Unlawful Consumption of Property

The speaker refers to a Quranic verse regarding the orphan's property:
“الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَالَ الْيَتَامَىٰ ظُلْمًا إِنَّمَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ نَارًا وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيرًا”
(Indeed, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire, and they will be burned in a blazing Fire.)
- [Reference needed]

This verse refers to eating the orphan's property "unjustly" (ظُلْمًا), meaning without a right. The Imam says that those who consume property unjustly are taking fire into their bellies. The speaker explains this concept further by linking it to the Imam's share (sahm-e-Imam), which is the Imam's property.
اللهم صل علی محمد و آل محمد و عجل فرجہم۔
(O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their reappearance).
Imam al-Zaman, peace be upon him, himself said in a tawqi' (signed letter) that "من اکل من اموالنا ظلما انما یاکل فی بطنه نارا و سیصلی سعیرا" (Whoever eats from our property unjustly is only eating fire in his belly, and he will be cast into a blazing fire).

The speaker clarifies that "the Imam's property" refers to the Imam's share (sahm-e-Imam). Someone involved in distributing or collecting sahm-e-Imam can take a wage for their effort and time, but only a sufficient amount for an ordinary middle-class family to run their household in the current time, and no more. For further details, one should consult jurists (fuqaha) and maraji'. Eating the orphan's property (or the Imam's share unjustly) is thus a grave sin.

##### Transgressing Allah's Limits (General Sins)

Another evil stemming from the enemies of Ahl al-Bayt is:
“وَتَعَدِّي الْحُدُودِ الَّتِي أَمَرَ اللّٰهُ”
(and transgressing the limits that Allah has commanded).
This refers to crossing Allah's limits and committing sins in general. A sin can be committed in two ways: by doing something forbidden (e.g., drinking alcohol) or by not doing something obligatory (tarke wajib). For example, a young person not praying is a sin. Neglecting an obligation is forbidden and punishable by Allah.

The speaker laments the common parental neglect in waking children for Fajr prayer, often rationalizing that the child is tired or sleeping. However, if the house were on fire and the child was in danger, no parent would say "let them sleep"; they would immediately save the child. The speaker urges parents to consider the eternal fire of hell, which the Quran describes as having "فَاتَّقُوا النَّارَ الَّتِي وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ” (Then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones).
- [Reference needed]
Parents are urged to emphasize prayer and other acts of worship to their children. Hadith states that a child should be commanded to pray at age seven, and if they don't pray by age ten, they should be lightly hit (not to cause hatred, but to signify importance).
Similarly, Hajj is often neglected even by those who are `sahib-e-istita'at` (able to afford it). Hajj is obligatory, and narrations state that if a `mustati'` (able) person dies without performing Hajj, they die the death of a Jew or a Christian, not a Muslim. The Imams even emphasize performing Hajj by taking a loan if necessary due to its paramount importance.

##### Avoiding Indecencies and Other Forbidden Acts

The Imam then lists other evils to be avoided:
“وَالرُّكُوبُ الْفَوَاحِشُ” (And committing indecencies), meaning bad deeds, dirty deeds, whether apparent or hidden.
“وَالزِّنَا” (and adultery/fornication).
“وَالسَّرِقَةُ” (and theft).
“وَكُلُّ مَا وَقَفَ عَنِ الْقَبِيحِ” (and everything that is deemed ugly/reprehensible), meaning everything considered bad or forbidden in Islam. One must stay away from such acts.

### The Criterion of True Love and Adherence to Ahl al-Bayt (AS)

After distinguishing between good and evil, the Imam states a crucial sentence:
“فَكَذَّبَ مَن زَعَمَ أَنَّهُ مَعَنَا وَهُوَ مُتَعَلِّقٌ بِفُرُوعِ غَيْرِنَا”
(So whoever claims that he is with us, while he is attached to the branches of others, has lied).
This means that a person who claims to be from the Ahl al-Bayt's followers, their lover, or their Shi'a, yet his actions align with their enemies (e.g., committing forbidden acts and sins), is a liar in his claim of love. Such a person cannot truly be a lover of Ahl al-Bayt.
The speaker mentions another related hadith and Quranic verse, where Allah has forbidden all فواحش (indecencies) – both apparent (bad deeds) and hidden (drawing close to the enemies of Ahl al-Bayt, or even listening to those who usurped their rights).

### The Manifestation of Wilayat: The Story of Maytham al-Tammar

The speaker transitions to a practical example of true Wilayat, mentioning Janab Maytham al-Nahrawani, also known as Maytham al-Tammar (due to his date stall). He was from Nahrawan, an Iraqi. Maytham was completely immersed in the love and Wilayat of Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS).

#### Amir al-Mu'minin's Prophecy to Maytham

Maytham narrated that one day, Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) called him and asked: "O Maytham, what will be your state when the vile Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad of Banu Umayyah tells you to curse Ali, to speak ill of Ali?"
Maytham, with unwavering conviction, replied: "O Commander of the Faithful, by God! I can never do this. I will never do it."
The Master then asked if he knew the outcome. Maytham asked, "What will happen, Master?" Imam Ali (AS) replied: "They will kill you and crucify you."
Maytham's beautiful answer was: "I will endure a little hardship." The Master then promised: "إذن تَكُونُ مَعِي فِي دَرَجَتِي" (Then you will be with me in my rank in Paradise).

#### Maytham's Unwavering Faith and Preparation for Martyrdom

Maytham's faith was so strong that he would pass by the chief (`arif) of his people and say:
“یا فُلاں کانی بِکا” (O so-and-so, I see you), then he would prophesy: "I see that the vile person from Banu Umayyah is calling you and tells you to bring Maytham to him. And you take me to that vile person, and that vile person from Banu Umayyah crucifies me."
Maytham then went to `Amr ibn Hurayth and told him that his murder would happen very soon, and he would become his neighbor. `Amr replied, "I wish it were so."
Following the Master's prophecy that he would be crucified on a date tree outside `Amr ibn Hurayth's house, Maytham would repeatedly pass by that specific tree, watering it and irrigating it to ensure it wouldn't dry up. This demonstrates his profound belief and certainty in the prophecy.

#### Confrontation with Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad

The time of the prophecy eventually arrived. Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, لعنت اللہ علیہ (may Allah's curse be upon him), became the governor of Kufa and summoned Maytham. He first called the tribal chief and demanded Maytham be brought to him. Maytham was then brought before Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad.
A detailed conversation ensued. Ibn Ziyad asked, "Are you Maytham?" Maytham proudly affirmed, "Yes, I am Maytham." (The speaker clarifies the correct pronunciation is "Maytham", not "Maytham").
Ibn Ziyad ordered, "Curse Abu Turab. Abuse Abu Turab." Maytham feigned ignorance, "Who is Abu Turab? I don't know any Abu Turab." Ibn Ziyad then explicitly said, "You don't know Abu Turab? Curse Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin)."
Maytham challenged him, "What if I don't?" Ibn Ziyad threatened, "I will kill you."
Maytham then recounted the prophecy of Imam Ali (AS): "My Master used to say this, that Maytham, you will be killed and crucified on the tree outside `Amr ibn Hurayth's house. And after three days of crucifixion, on the fourth day, blood will start flowing from your nose, meaning your death will come. For three days, you will remain crucified like this, and on the fourth day, you will die."
Ibn Ziyad the cursed, enraged, ordered that Maytham be crucified exactly as described.

#### Maytham's Final Words and the Tyranny of Ibn Ziyad

As Maytham was being taken away, he addressed the people of Kufa:
“اے اہلِ کُوفہ!” (O people of Kufa!) "If you want to know anything about the future, ask me; I will tell you." He claimed he could tell them about all the tribulations that would occur until the Day of Judgment. This demonstrated the immense knowledge granted to a true lover of the Commander of the Faithful.
When people began asking questions, Ibn Ziyad, fearing Maytham's influence, ordered Maytham's mouth to be tied with thick ropes so he could not speak. It is recorded in hadith that Maytham was the first person in Islam whose mouth was tied in such a manner. This barbaric practice later became common among Banu Umayyah, then Banu Marwan, and even Banu Abbas, used against anyone who spoke too much.

This incident served as a prelude to Karbala. Maytham's words foreshadowed the injustices to come. The speaker highlights that Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, do not engage in deception; they act openly. For instance, Janab Muslim ibn Aqil had the opportunity to kill Ibn Ziyad in Hani ibn `Urwah's house but did not, as it goes against the principles of Ahl al-Bayt. Yet, Ibn Ziyad later committed atrocities against Janab Muslim, which further set the stage for Karbala.

### The Exemplary Sacrifice: The Children of Sayyida Zaynab (AS) at Karbala

The lecture then shifts to the tragic events of Ashura in Karbala. On the day of Ashura, after the martyrdom of the children of Aqil among Banu Hashim, it was the turn of the children of Abdullah ibn Ja'far (who were Sayyida Zaynab's sons).

#### Zaynab's Exhortation to Her Sons

Sayyida Zaynab (AS) told her sons, Muhammad and Awn: "Go, my sons, go take permission from your uncle [Imam Husayn], and go be martyred. Go sacrifice yourselves for your uncle." When her children requested her to seek permission from their uncle herself, Zaynab took both children by the hand and stood silently before Husayn.
Imam Husayn, recognizing his sister's silent plea, asked, "Sister Zaynab, why have you come?" She replied, "Brother, you know why I have come. And I know you will not reject my plea, brother. Now, grant permission to these children. The family of Muslim have also been martyred. Now, let my children be martyred, let them be sacrificed." Husayn granted permission.

It is written in the martyrologies that Zaynab took both children to the tent and prepared them herself. While doing so, she instructed them: "Look, my sons, you are going for martyrdom, for sacrifice, for battle, but take great care of two things. One, fight in such a way that people themselves say that these are the grandsons of Ja'far ibn Abi Talib, and these are the grandsons of Ja'far al-Tayyar and the great grandsons of Haydar-e-Karrar." She quoted Mir Anis: "Why would you say they are the sons of God's saint? The armies would cry out that they are the grandsons of Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin)."
She then added the second, poignant instruction: "My sons, look, I know you have been hungry and thirsty for three days, but do not turn towards water. Because the children in the tent are thirsty. Ali al-Asghar is thirsty. Sakina is thirsty. Everyone in the tent is thirsty. Do not even think about water."

#### Their Martyrdom and Zaynab's Fortitude

One brother attacked the right flank, and the other attacked the left, sending horsemen and infantrymen to hell. Umar ibn Sa'd, witnessing their valor, commanded, "Surround and kill them! These are children of Banu Hashim, not children of Kufa's grocers and rubbish collectors! Surround and kill them!"
The enemy surrounded them. First, one brother fell from his horse, then the other. They called out, "Uncle! Goodbye!" Husayn, accompanied by `Abbas, his strength, rushed to the battlefield. By the time they arrived, both children had already passed away. Husayn picked up one body, and `Abbas picked up the other. They brought them and placed them in the tent.

When the bodies were placed in the tent, Fiddha came to Zaynab, who was on her prayer mat, and said, "My Lady, come see, the princes have arrived." Zaynab, displaying immense fortitude, replied, "I did not tell them to return. Why have they returned?" Fiddha respectfully urged, "My Lady, please come and see in what state they have arrived."
When Zaynab saw the sight – Awn's body on one side and Muhammad's on the other – a sight that Allah should not show any mother, she prostrated in gratitude, saying, "O Lord! Accept this small sacrifice of mine." The speaker emphasizes that Zaynab is not found to have mourned for Awn and Muhammad at that time. Her mourning was always for Husayn and his family. On the eleventh of Muharram, in Kufa, in Shaam, and upon her return to Karbala, she did not mourn for Awn and Muhammad.

#### Zaynab's Profound Grief Upon Return to Medina

Finally, when Zaynab returned from Karbala to Medina, she sat outside her house, aged by the tragedies. Abdullah ibn Ja'far, her husband, did not recognize her initially. He asked, "My Lady, why are you sitting outside? Go to your house." Zaynab removed her veil, "O Abdullah, did you not recognize me?" Abdullah, witnessing Zaynab's condition, cried out and wept loudly. He took her arm and brought her into the house.
Until that moment, Zaynab had maintained her immense patience. But as soon as she entered the house and saw the tiny beds of Awn and Muhammad, her mother's heart shattered. She remembered her children and cried out:
“وا عونہ! وا محمدہ! وا حُسینا!” (O Awn! O Muhammad! O Husayn!).
The lecture concludes with a Quranic verse:
“سَیعلَمُ الَّذینَ ظَلَموا ایَّ مُنقَلَبٍ یَنقَلِبُونَ۔”
(And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned.)

“أَلَا لَعنَۃُ اللہ عَلَی القَومِ الظَّالِمِین۔”
(Unquestionably, the curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.)
