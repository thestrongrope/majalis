### Introduction

#### The Transformation of Hurr: A Poetic Introduction

Please listen to a few verses of a marsiya (elegy) about Janab Hurr (peace be upon him). It was in Hurr's destiny to become a man of faith. It was in Hurr's destiny to become a man of faith, to be a servant at the court of the glorious master. To be sacrificed by the very sword he brought. It is true, it is not easy to be a Muslim in this way. The one who is to awaken, will awaken from wherever he may be. The heart's longing keeps him awake all night, until the morning call to prayer. And when the impurity is removed from the human heart, the tablet of the mind is polished with refinement. When the heart is pure, the atmosphere becomes pure. And like a flower, the eye of desire opens in eagerness. In a moment, the distance shrinks. Even if the world comes before you, it moves aside. And he who is blessed with the companionship of the great one, even for a few moments, whenever he rises from a low state, he is blessed with exaltation. If he places his head on the holy feet, he is blessed with paradise. From the dust of the feet, he is blessed with the wealth of both worlds. And this dust in the hand becomes like a rosary. If it accompanies him, it will open the door to paradise.

And Hurr fulfilled this desire by risking his life. Life fulfilled the hope of the night of separation. Today, the worship of destiny was completed. And the list of martyrdom began to appear. Look at the attraction of the garden of paradise. It is as if someone is being pulled by the collar. When it was seen that horsemen were coming from here and there, the supporters of the king became ready in their places. The sword was in the brave hand, waiting for the command. The dignity of the great master was holding everyone back. The king explained that they are wary of the guests. The poor souls, where else can they go but here?

And in what state did Janab Hurr come? He came on foot towards the master of splendors. The man of faith came towards the center of truth. With the pain of sin in his heart, he came for a cure. He came with his hands tied, with tears in his eyes. Hurr pleaded, "Have mercy, O likeness of the Messiah! We are dying without death, bring us back to life. We are ruined by our mistake, O Master! We blocked the path and lost the destination. The ways of the world were of no use to us. A hope for mercy has drawn us here. We are on the ground, carrying the burden of our sins. The heads of sinners are indeed at your holy feet. Shame does not allow us to raise our heads, O Master. The honor of your slaves is in your hands. If you wish, you can change our fate. The paradise of sinners is at these very feet." Holding the master's robe, he began to wash his face with tears. Sobbing, the brave Hurr began to cry.

A compassionate voice came, "Hurr, look up! Don't be so distressed. You have come to the path of truth, be grateful. I have forgiven you, and my Allah has forgiven you." When nations reject this tyranny, they will call freedom "Hurriyat" (freedom). The king looked at Hurr with a gaze of favor. Repentance was proud that he looked with a gaze of mercy. He gave life with a miraculous gaze. He looked at his guest with a farewell gaze. He entrusted the matter to a strange, meaningful connection with fate. The master said to Hurr, "Go, I entrust you to God."

When Hurr took leave from the king of the faith to die, his companions went with increasing loyalty. They went with pride, with the color of eternity. They carried the prayer of Zainab in the vessel of their hearts. Those who are to die, shake off the hand of death. This is how those who have done wrong atone for their sins. The atonement was made, all sorrows were erased. He called out to the king, "Accept the salutation of your servant. May your protection remain, your slave is leaving." His breath began to fail, his strength waned. Taking the name of the king of both worlds, he fell silent. Saying "Ya Hussain ibn Ali," he fell unconscious. When the king placed his hand on the wound, his eyes opened. It was the final moment, and the master's face was before him. A smile appeared on his lips, the bud of his purpose blossomed. And from the mantle of mercy, the breeze of paradise began to blow. Hurr said, "My eyes are closing. My fortune is awake, and I am feeling sleepy." He received the vision of the king's face, the wealth of both worlds. His heart found peace, his soul found tranquility. If love was obligatory, the vision was also a duty. Where would Hurr turn his face? Hussain was the qibla (direction of prayer) of the world. Hurr passed away after seeing the king. He passed away after reciting from the speaking Quran.

And after that, what did the Master of Martyrs do? The likeness of the Messiah took careful action. In a special state, he administered a very special remedy. He tied the wound on Hurr's head with his mother's scarf. Let the oppressors themselves see who died and who lived. Hurr received this life-giving thread of purity. He found a point of interpretation for "Do not say (of those who are slain in the way of Allah, 'They are dead.')". My master, my head and body are sacrificed for your merciful eyes. We will cry for you our whole lives, O king of the age. We will keep our robes soaked in your grief. By God, Ahsan is blessed by your grace. My eyes will long to cry for themselves. When your name is mentioned, they will shed tears.

#### The Hadith of Imam Hussain (AS) on True Worship

The noble hadith that has been chosen for discussion during these ten majalis, in this hadith, the Master of Martyrs says:

Our master Husain ibn Ali, peace be upon them, has spoken the truth.
- [Reference needed]

Blessings be upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.

#### Ma'rifat (Recognition) as the Basis of Worship

The discussion was about Imamate, and it was that the meaning of "the right of worship" is that worship which is accompanied by Ma'rifat (Recognition). As long as a person does not have Ma'rifat (Recognition), his worship has no meaning and no concept. There is no benefit in such worship in which he does not recognize the one he is worshipping.

#### The Importance of Recognizing the Imam (Wilayah)

For Ma'rifat (Recognition), it is necessary to recognize the door that Allah has made, through which one should come, that is, to recognize the Imam of the time, that is, to recognize the twelve Imams whose obedience has been made obligatory upon us. Therefore, what I presented to you until yesterday was that the situation changed after the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. When we present this argument that, for example, there are so many verses and so many narrations about the Wilayah (guardianship) of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him:

*   There are many verses, approximately more than 500-600 verses in the Quran, more than 600 verses that only talk about Wilayah (guardianship).
*   Similarly, there are many narrations, many hadiths.
*   The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, was repeatedly introducing Ali, peace be upon him, during his life that after me, he is my successor, my caliph.
*   Finally, at Ghadir Khumm, he also said that the Wilayah (guardianship) of Ali is the religion, and the religion is the Wilayah (guardianship) of Ali.
*   The Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, made it clear that the religion in which there is no Wilayah (guardianship) of Ali is not a religion.

Therefore, this Wilayah (guardianship) is very important, but the question arises that when the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, introduced him so many times, why did people not obey the Prophet's, peace be upon him and his holy family, words?

### Historical Patterns of Disobedience

#### Quranic Parallels: Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) Experience and Previous Messengers

Look, the answer to this question is present in the Quran and in the narrations. There are many verses in the Quran; we will only present two or three verses to you that will make the matter completely clear for you. It is said in the Holy Quran that, "O Prophet, these people who are talking to you, that is, all the nonsensical things they are saying, those who are around you, they are not only doing this to you, but to all the messengers who came before you, they have said such things." That is, their people all said such things. So:

ŸÖÿß €åŸÇÿßŸÑ ŸÑ⁄© ÿßŸÑÿß ŸÖÿß ŸÇÿØ ŸÇ€åŸÑ ŸÑŸÑÿ±ÿ≥ŸÑ ŸÖŸÜ ŸÇÿ®ŸÑ⁄©
Nothing is said to you that was not said to the messengers before you.
- [Reference needed]

That is, what is being said to you, that is, not said, whatever it is, that is, in Arabic, when 'ma' and 'illa' come, they are used for restriction, meaning only that, that is, exactly what the previous nations did, this nation will also do, there is no difference in it. In another verse, it is said, "If they are belying you, if they are denying you, then all the messengers who came before you, they denied all of them." This has always been the problem of this majority of the nation, this is not the first time. Their job is to belie, their job is to deny. So the Quran is saying this in very clear words.

But when such verses are narrated, it is said that no, this is about the polytheists in Mecca, who did not believe in the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, and the people of Mecca, it is about them, not about Medina. In Medina, there were Muslims and companions and so on. So if you look, if you study those verses as well, it will become completely clear to you. For example, in Surah Al-Imran, verse number 144, it is said:

ŸàŸÖÿß ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿßŸÑÿß ÿ±ÿ≥ŸàŸÑ
And Muhammad is not but a messenger.
- [Reference needed]

Send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.

ŸÇÿØ ÿÆŸÑÿ™ ŸÖŸÜ ŸÇÿ®ŸÑ€Å ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≥ŸÑ
Many other messengers have passed away before him.
- [Reference needed]

They have passed away before him. "If this messenger dies, or is killed, will you turn back on your heels? Will you flee, leave the messenger, leave the religion? And whoever turns back on his heels, he will not harm Allah at all. And Allah will soon reward the grateful." That is, those who stand with the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, Allah will reward them. And those who turn their backs, who show their backs to the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, they will get their punishment and they will be counted among the enemies of the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, among the enemies of Islam. But they do not harm the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, they do not harm the religion. And there are many such verses that interpret this, if you study the verses, you will find it regularly, and the Quran has said it repeatedly, the Quran has said it repeatedly that to the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, in Surah Tawbah also, it is that around you, all these are hypocrites, these are around you, look at the verses of Surah Tawbah, the verses of Surah Munafiqun, read them all, you will see in what environment the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, was living. So the situation on all four sides was such that there was no one with the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, except for a few individuals who could be counted on fingers. There were many for the sake of name, but very few with true faith.

#### The Prophecy of "Like One Shoe Follows Another" (Hadith of Hudhu al-Na'l)

For example, you see this famous hadith of the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, "The Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, said, 'The Prophet prophesied, that is, he prophesied beforehand that everything that happened in the Children of Israel will happen in this nation.'" Whatever happened in the Children of Israel, the same will happen in this nation. And this hadith is not only in Shia books, both parties have narrated it, it is a very famous and well-known hadith. Exactly what the Children of Israel did, exactly the same thing will happen here in this Muslim nation. That is, wherever the Children of Israel set foot, this nation will set foot there. And wherever their arrow went, the arrow of this nation will follow that arrow. This is called ÿ≠ÿ∞Ÿà ÿßŸÑŸÜÿπŸÑ ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÜÿπŸÑ (like one shoe follows another), that is, exactly what happened.

#### The Samiri and the Golden Calf: A Parallel to Post-Prophetic Events

Now you read the entire history of the Children of Israel, the entire history of the Children of Israel is before you. Prophet Musa, peace be upon him, went for only a few days, for 40 days, and what did they do? They made a calf and worshipped it. The calf, that is, a small calf. And who was the one who made it? It was Samiri. And he said, "This is your god." This is your god, our god, Musa's god. Everyone's god is this, a calf. And this calf, and Samiri had this power, what did he do? Just to deceive these people, he made the calf make a sound. He made it make a sound, the sound that a calf makes, the calf was making it, the calf that he himself had made, it was not a natural calf, he had made it. Now how did this sound come? How was this man-made animal making a sound? So when Prophet Musa asked Samiri how he did this, he said, "I saw," because Samiri was very close to Prophet Musa, peace be upon him, very close at one time. What did he see? He saw that Prophet Jibra'il, peace be upon him, was with Prophet Musa, on his horse. So he understood that this is an angel of Allah, and when this is an angel of Allah, then the horse he is on is also a heavenly horse. So now that this is a heavenly horse, there must be some miracles in the dust that is under its hooves. So the verse of the Quran is:

ŸÅŸÇÿ®ÿ∂ÿ™ ŸÇÿ®ÿ∂€É ŸÖŸÜ ÿßÿ´ÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≥ŸàŸÑ
So I took a handful of dust from the trail of the messenger.
- [Reference needed]

The messenger here refers to Jibra'il. That is, the footsteps that Jibra'il left, from the hooves of his horse, I took a handful of dust from it. I did not take it from Jibra'il's body, nor from Prophet Musa's body. The horse on which Jibra'il was, the dust under its hooves, Samiri took that dust and kept it safe. And when he made this calf, he blew into it, and the calf started to make a sound. Now all the Muslims recite this verse with great enthusiasm, but no one asks this question that how did this dust have so much power that it made the lifeless come to life, that it started to speak.

So now you think that when we say that this knowledge is attributed to Imam Hussain, all these things are attributed to Imam Hussain, then Jibra'il, who is the servant of the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, or rather, it is found in the narrations that the angels of God are the servants of your Shias. So when the dust from the hooves of the horse of the servant of the Shias of the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, has so much effect, then the Dhuljanah that we take out in the name of Imam Hussain, if we take blessings from it, why are you surprised by it? Go and object to the Quran. Send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad. This is the situation of the Muslims. They read the Quran, but they do not see what is in front of them. They do not see what is right in front of them at all. That brother, this is written in the Quran, this is a miracle of the Quran. And when the same thing is happening in the Muslim nation, we are objecting to it. We object to everything. Why is this, why is that?

#### The Justification of Saqifah and Its Critique

So here we saw what happened in the Children of Israel. There was a Samiri and there was a calf. Why did Samiri make the calf? Did he love the calf? No, he was using the calf as a pretext, so that by using it, he would later come to power. It is clear to you. Once I bring it, then I will come to power myself. The same thing happened in Islam. The Prophet's, peace be upon him and his holy family, eyes had not yet closed, the shroud had not yet become dirty, that all the Muslims left the Prophet's, peace be upon him and his holy family, body and went away. Here the Prophet's, peace be upon him and his holy family, sacred body is lying, and all the Muslims are busy in Saqifah. You read the books and ask the question why this happened.

Now, the people who read and wrote the books, they understood that the matter here is very serious, this is a very complicated issue, and the car can get stuck here. So now what did they do? They justified it. Look, there is a saying in Persian that "the excuse for a sin is worse than the sin." So now they said that this is the problem, so what did they say? That all these people who were lovers of the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, they all left the Prophet's, peace be upon him and his holy family, body and went to Saqifah and were appointing a caliph because, listen to their answer, because more important than the Prophet's, peace be upon him and his holy family, burial and funeral rites was to appoint a caliph so that there would be no discord in the nation, no problem in the nation. So the answer to this is very simple, that sir, these companions who reached Saqifah, they understood that selecting an Imam is more important than the Prophet's, peace be upon him and his holy family, funeral and burial rites, so that there is no discord in the nation. Did the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, not understand this that after me there should be an Imam so that there is no discord in the nation? This is a very basic point, a very basic intellect, there is no need for a great rocket scientist for this, it is a very simple thing. So whatever happened in the Children of Israel, exactly the same thing happened here.

### Understanding Taqiyyah (Dissimulation)

It's just that, look, one thing to keep in mind is that whatever we say, whatever we discuss, it should be done very carefully because the Imams, peace be upon them, have taught us one thing which is called Taqiyyah (Dissimulation). This Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) is to save one's religion, for the survival of the religion. If a person does not practice Taqiyyah (Dissimulation), the survival of the religion will be difficult. That is, he should decide where to say something and where not to say something.

#### The Purpose and Importance of Taqiyyah

Regarding Taqiyyah (Dissimulation), we present only this hadith to you, that is, for the children, for the youth, so that the matter becomes clear for them. Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him, says, "Protect your religion. Look, protect your religion, save the religion, and for this, what should you do? Keep it hidden with Taqiyyah (Dissimulation)." That is, not everything is said in front of everyone. Not everything is said in front of everyone.

#### Imam Sadiq's (AS) Analogy of the Honeybee

Why? The Imam continues, "Because whoever does not have Taqiyyah (Dissimulation), he does not have faith. He does not have faith. Look, your example among other Muslims is like that of a honeybee among birds." See what analogy the Imam is giving. "Your example is like that of a honeybee among birds. If the birds find out how much honey is in the stomach of this honeybee, what will they do? Then nothing will be left in it, except that the birds will kill and eat the honeybee." Similarly, if the enemies of the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, the Nasibis, find out what religion you have in your heart, what knowledge, what teachings of the family of Muhammad you have, then they will not let you live for a moment. They will not leave you. These are the words of the Imam. "If people find out what is in your chest, what beliefs, what Wilayah (guardianship), what Bara'at (disassociation), what ideologies you have, if they find out all that, that how you love us, the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, they will not leave you alive. They will eat you with their tongues. And they will finish you both secretly and openly. You will not be able to escape." Therefore, for the survival of the religion, Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) is very necessary.

#### The Five Rulings of Taqiyyah by Sheikh Murtada Ansari

But remember, this is a very important point I am presenting to you. Generally, people misunderstand Taqiyyah (Dissimulation). That is why one of our great religious scholars, whose name is Sheikh Murtada Ansari, wrote a book called "Risalat al-Taqiyyah". Let me tell you, a greater jurist than Sheikh Murtada Ansari has never been born after him. Yes, a greater jurist than him, just understand this much, he was a very great jurist. He became a mujtahid at the age of 66, sorry, at the age of 50. He was born in 1216 and became a mujtahid in 1266, he became the marja' (religious authority) of the entire Shia world. And after that, he passed away in 1281. That is, he was a very great marja'. His title is ÿÆÿßÿ™ŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÇ€Åÿßÿ° (the seal of the jurists), that is, the seal of the jurists. No greater jurist was born after him. He wrote a book, "Risalat al-Taqiyyah". In it, he says that Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) has five rulings:

*   Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) is also obligatory.
*   Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) is also recommended.
*   Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) is also forbidden.
*   Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) is disliked.
*   Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) is also permissible.

These are his words. We have given you the name of the book, and its page number is 13. We are also giving the page number, you can refer to it yourself. Page number 13, "Risalat al-Taqiyyah". He writes it very clearly.

#### When Taqiyyah is Forbidden: Protecting Religion and Wilayah

So when is this Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) forbidden? This is a very important point. Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) is forbidden at that time when if we go to practice Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) and the religion is destroyed, the religion is finished. In the ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§ï‡§∞ (midst) of Taqiyyah (Dissimulation), our religion is gone, the religion of our generation, the religion of our children, everything is destroyed. We are busy in the ‡§ö‡§ï‡•ç‡§ï‡§∞ (midst) of Taqiyyah (Dissimulation), and it turns out that our generation, our children, they don't even know what Wilayah (guardianship) is. They don't even know what Bara'at (disassociation) is. They don't even know what Tabarra (cursing the enemies of Ahl al-Bayt) is called. Why do we do Azadari (mourning)? Why do we do Matam (beating the chest)? Are you with me or not? They say not to do all this. If you don't tell your children, how will the children know? Who usurped the right of Ali, peace be upon him? Who martyred Janab Fatimah Zahra, peace be upon her? Who shot arrows at the funeral of Imam Hasan Mujtaba, peace be upon him? Who poisoned Imam Hasan Mujtaba, peace be upon him? All this history, the historical facts, should be told to our children. And it is necessary to tell them. And the important thing is, you should try to tell them from their books as well, it would be very good, very good. Our own books are all there, but from their books as well. But make the children familiar with all these things so that their religion remains safe. That is why the Commander of the Faithful says in Nahj al-Balagha, "O people, protect your religion, protect your religion. See that no one does this, that he snatches your religion from you." Therefore, it is necessary for us to tell them all these things. So the Imam says that you should practice this Taqiyyah (Dissimulation), it is very necessary. But where the matter of religion comes, there Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) is forbidden. Where the matter of protecting Wilayah (guardianship) comes.

#### Historical Examples Against Forbidden Taqiyyah

And look, there is no hidden matter in this. If people say that Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) should be in all situations, then if it was in all situations, then why did the martyrdom of the Master of Martyrs occur? Why did the martyrdom of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, occur? Did Janab Zahra, peace be upon her, go and give a sermon or not? And in that sermon, did she state all the facts or not? If those who have not read the sermon, we request them to go and read the sermon. It is a 15-page sermon in the book. Just a 15-page sermon. You can translate it with ChatGPT and tell the children. Look, this is it, it's very simple, a 15-page sermon. See what the princess says. The sermon of Janab Salman, three days after the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, what did Janab Salman say? You can see it. After that, you see the entire incident of Karbala is before you. How did Imam Baqir and Imam Sadiq, peace be upon them, spread the religion? That is, after telling the importance of everything, Imam Sadiq says, "May Allah have mercy on that servant from among you who is steadfast on our Wilayah (guardianship). Who is steadfast on our Wilayah (guardianship). Our love, our affection, our Wilayah (guardianship), this is very necessary. If we do not tell all this to the children, then how will it be?

### Wilayah: The Unwavering Obligation

#### The Hadith of Iblis and Adam: Obedience to Divine Command

Look, I present a hadith to you, which Sheikh Kulayni has narrated in al-Kafi. All these things have been written by our scholars. And these are the same scholars who have also written about Taqiyyah (Dissimulation). But along with that, they also narrate these hadiths so that the religion remains safe. You see, the religion remaining safe is very important. You see, pay attention to the sentences of the hadith. I will read the hadith slowly so that the children can understand. Look at the whole hadith. The Imam says, "If Iblis had worshipped for his entire life, that is, the life of this world, the entire life of this world, the age of the world, the age of the universe, if Iblis had worshipped for that entire age after his sin, which sin? The sin of not prostrating to Adam. After that sin, this worship would not have benefited him at all. And Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, would not have accepted anything from him. Allah would not have accepted any of his worship if he had worshipped for the entire age of the universe. Yes, brother, that is, our worship is not all of it, the entire age of the universe, if he had worshipped, it would have been of no use, no benefit. Why? Because he did not prostrate to Adam as Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, had commanded him to prostrate to Adam."

#### Quranic Examples of Prostration to Other Than Allah

Now, before continuing with the hadith, another reminder for the children, for the youth. In the Quran, in at least three places, it is said to prostrate to others besides Allah. Not to prostrate to Allah.

1.  **Adam and the Angels:** One, when Allah told the angels to prostrate to Adam. Was Adam God? Adam was not God. Was Adam God? No. The angels should have said, "O Lord, this is Shirk (polytheism), I seek refuge in Allah. What kind of God are you, commanding Shirk (polytheism)?" But all the angels went into prostration. Rather, the one who did not do it was given the title of Satan. This is one.
2.  **Prophet Yusuf (AS):** The second example from the Quran itself. Prophet Yusuf said, in the initial verses of Surah Yusuf, Prophet Yusuf says, "O my father," to whom is he saying this? To his father. Prophet Ya'qub, peace be upon him. "Father, I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon prostrating to me. I saw it in a dream." Prophet Ya'qub was a great prophet. Israel, you know, Israel was the name of Prophet Ya'qub. 'Isra' means servant, and 'El' means God. That is, the servant of Allah. The translation of 'Abdullah' in Hebrew is 'Israel'. Now Prophet Ya'qub was a great servant, that is why Allah gave him this title of Israel. Who can know the worship of Allah better than Prophet Ya'qub? But when a small child is saying that, "O father, I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon all prostrating to me," Prophet Ya'qub should have immediately said, "Son, this is Shirk (polytheism). What kind of dream have you seen? This is a bad thing, don't say such things." Prophet Yusuf was just a child, wasn't he? It's a child's dream. But Prophet Ya'qub did not say this. It is a verse from Surah Yusuf, you can read it, Surah Yusuf, chapter number 12 of the Quran. What did Prophet Ya'qub say? "O my son, look, do not tell this dream to your brothers. Keep it to yourself. Don't tell anyone, don't tell your brothers. Otherwise, they will start plotting against you. Why? Because Satan is an open enemy of man. Satan's plot is always to make people fight with each other." Now whenever you see someone who is doing this, making brother fight brother, friend fight friend, tribe fight tribe, wherever you see this nature, this action, then understand that he is guiding Satan. He is Satan's lawyer. Is it clear to you? He is advocating for him. He is making people fight with each other. And whenever someone comes with such a thing, you should immediately stop him, "Brother, you do your work, I know." And remember, Satan also does not do any work directly because he is a great master. He does not do the work directly. What does he do? He knows that if he goes through this person, he will listen. So sometimes he comes through parents, sometimes through siblings, sometimes through wife and children, sometimes through relatives, sometimes through friends. He knows all these things. So Prophet Ya'qub is telling his son, "Son, beware of Satan, do not tell this to anyone." This is Taqiyyah (Dissimulation). This is the Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) that Prophet Ya'qub is telling his son.

    Now when Prophet Yusuf became the ruler of Egypt and his parents and his brothers came, as soon as they came before him, Prophet Ya'qub, his wife, and all his children went into prostration before Yusuf. A prophet of God, didn't he know that prostrating to other than Allah is Shirk (polytheism)? So it turns out that only the actions of the Shias are Shirk (polytheism), everything else is permissible. Here is a prophet of God. Now whose turn is it? Prophet Yusuf's. Now Prophet Yusuf is not saying, "Father, what are you doing? This is wrong." Why? Because Prophet Yusuf knows that Ya'qub is not prostrating on his own, but by the command of Allah. And Ya'qub told his wife, his children, to prostrate to Yusuf. So everyone prostrated. So now it is Yusuf's turn. Now Yusuf does not say, "Father, what are you doing? Don't embarrass me, don't prostrate." Rather, Yusuf says, these are the words of the Quran, "This is the interpretation of my dream of before, O father. That was the same, this is the same." Send one blessing upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad. Is it clear to you?
3.  **The Gate of Forgiveness (Bab al-Hittah):** The third example from the Quran. The Quran says, "We said to the Children of Israel, all these Jews, We said to them that this is the Gate of Forgiveness, enter through it." These are the words of the Quran. "Enter this gate, the gate of the city, and keep saying 'Hittah' (forgiveness). If you do these two things, what was the first thing? Prostration. What should be mentioned in the prostration? 'Hittah'. Just say 'Hittah'. This gate was called the Gate of Forgiveness. What does the Gate of Forgiveness mean? The one through which all sins are shed. It is written in our exegesis that Allah commanded this, this is our exegesis. Now whoever wants to believe it, let him believe it. It is the exegesis of our Imam, brother. The exegesis of the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them. The exegesis of the Thaqalayn. Whoever wants to believe it, let him believe it. Whoever wants to follow the people of opinion, the people of analogy, the people of innovation, let them follow them. What do we have to do with it? We only interpret the Thaqalayn. So they have written in it that on this Gate of Forgiveness was written, "Ya Muhammad, Ya Ali." A cry of Haideri, "Ya Ali!" And for this, it was said to go in prostration. Prostrate, "Ya Muhammad, Ya Ali." Go in prostration here and keep saying "Hittah, Hittah," all your sins will be forgiven.

#### The Unique Status of the Ahl al-Bayt (AS)

Now here is a question. We have presented these three examples to you. Look, no one says, no one, if he says so, he is at least not a Muslim, he is outside the religion, who calls the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, God. Whoever calls the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, God and attributes divinity and lordship and godhood and divinity to them, he is not a Shia, he is outside the religion. The Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, are the servants of Allah. But the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, being the servants of Allah does not mean that the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, are servants of Allah like us. There is a world of difference between the two. A world of difference. The Commander of the Faithful says in Nahj al-Balagha that we are the creation of Allah. Allah created us, and after that, we created all the creatures. We created them. The meaning of ÿÆŸÑŸÇŸÜÿß (we created) is ŸÖÿµŸÜŸàÿπ (created), that which has been created, that which has been created. This is Arabic. Now if you want to justify it, you and the Commander of the Faithful know. Who are we to interfere? If you don't want to believe it, then don't believe it. But it is in Nahj al-Balagha. So the Master says that to consider the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, as God is a major sin, Shirk (polytheism). Therefore, do not do any such act that this accusation is made that they consider the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, as God. But after that, the Imams themselves say, "Just don't call us God. After that, read as many of our virtues as you want, you will never be able to reach us. You will never be able to reach us. As much as you want, just don't say God, just say servant, just say creation of Allah. You can never reach."

And that is why when the Commander of the Faithful, look at the incident, this is a poem by Shafi'i. Shafi'i says, you know Imam Shafi'i, they say Imam Shafi'i. Yes, Imam Shafi'i, look, we are emphasizing this. It is a poem by Imam Shafi'i that they tell me to praise Ali. I tell them, if I say he is a human, then reason says no, a human cannot be like this. Reason says an ordinary man cannot be like this. And I fear Allah to say that Ali is Allah. It is clear to you. We are giving you examples only so that you understand why people in history were so scared.

#### The Infallibility of Angels and Their Learning from Ahl al-Bayt (AS)

Let's go higher, to the heavens. When Allah created the angels, and all Muslims believe this that angels are infallible. All Muslims, is there any Muslim who does not believe that angels are infallible? All Muslims believe that angels are infallible and they do whatever Allah commands them to do. Now look what is written in the narrations. That when Allah created the angels, when they saw the light of the family of Muhammad, they were so overwhelmed that they thought that this is God. Seeing the light of the family of Muhammad. So the Master says that when we saw that such a thought was coming to the angels, we started glorifying Allah. So the angels also started glorifying Allah, and the angels understood that we are not God. Then when they came to the second stage, the angels saw such a great light again in the second stage, and the angels were even more overwhelmed. So then we said,

ŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑ€Å ÿßŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑ€Å
There is no god but Allah.
- [Reference needed]

The angels understood that Allah is different, we are different. And then the angels also said,

ŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑ€Å ÿßŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑ€Å
There is no god but Allah.
- [Reference needed]

And in this way, the angels learned glorification and declaration of the oneness of God from the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them. What a thing! They learned from the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them.

Now look, reflect on this. Pir Hamid Hussain Hindi, may Allah be pleased with him, you know, the author of "Abaqat al-Anwar", he did a great work, no less than a miracle, "Abaqat al-Anwar". You pray that its entire English translation comes to light, God willing. So that all the children can read it. You pray, God willing, its translation is in progress. In it, he has taken a whole volume on the hadith of light, "I and Ali are from one light." On this, he has taken more than a hundred references from the books of other Muslims, not from Shia books, more than a hundred, to show that these hadiths are authentic, which we were just presenting to you. Send one blessing upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.

#### The Unconditional Nature of Wilayah

So the Imam says, "If Iblis had prostrated for the entire life of the world, this prostration would not have benefited him, and Allah would not have accepted his worship." And then he says, now pay attention to the sentence, "And similarly is this nation." This nation, which nation? The disobedient nation that did not obey its Prophet, the disobedient one. The one that was tested, the nation that was tested after its Prophet, when they left that Imam, the Imam whom their Prophet had appointed for them, that Imam, that is, Ali ibn Abi Talib, whom Allah and His Messenger had appointed, they left him. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, will not accept any deed of this nation, any deed, because they left that Imam whom Allah and His Messenger had appointed. And none of their good deeds will be accepted. Not a single one of their good deeds will be accepted until they present their deeds through that Imam whom Allah has appointed. The whole hadith continues.

After that, the Imam says, "And our Wilayah (guardianship) is one of the obligatory things that Allah has made obligatory." That is, prayer, fasting, Hajj, Zakat, all these are obligatory. But the Imam says that for everyone, Allah has forgiven it on some occasion. For example, if a person is very sick, in the hospital, his condition is very bad, he cannot pray, then he can just pray by making gestures while lying down. Just lying down. Like if he is buried under rubble, he is buried under rubble, you understand rubble, right? He is buried in debris. So he was buried in that rubble for three days. So when he came out, he said that for three days, not a single one of my prayers was missed. For three days, I was praying by making gestures. You see, there are such people who pray. And look at us, what happens? We make excuses for small things. So what? Anyway, in this prayer, gestures are enough. Similarly, there is fasting. Allah has forgiven fasting. Allah has forgiven fasting. And similarly, for whom is it forgiven? If someone is sick, if someone is on a journey, for women, sometimes it is forgiven. So it is exempted for all of them. Similarly, for Hajj, the condition is that one should be able to afford it. If a person has the ability, then he can perform Hajj. Similarly, there is Zakat. If one has the Nisab (minimum amount), then he should give Zakat, otherwise Zakat is not obligatory for him. The Imam says, "But our Wilayah (guardianship) is that for which there is never any exemption." In every situation, that is, from the time a person recognizes the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, until the moment of death, if he holds on to the belief of the Ahl al-Bayt, peace be upon them, firmly, teach your children, "Ya Ali, Ya Ali." So if we teach them to say "Ya Ali" today, then surely Ali will come in the grave and say, "This is ours, this is ours." If we teach the children to do Matam (beating the chest), believe me, Hussain will come for his intercession in the grave. Believe me, teach the children, "I don't know anyone except Hussain. I only know Hussain, that's all. I don't know anyone else."

It is a famous incident. That man died, and his night in the grave passed very easily. When his family saw him in a dream, they asked, "How was the night?" He said, "It was very easy." Actually, they did not see him, they saw a scholar who was buried next to him. So his children said, "You had it so easy, you have so much knowledge and so many services, you have written so many books." He said, "None of that worked." Then what happened? He said, "Next to me, a Bedouin from near Karbala, that is, a villager, was buried. So when the angels came, they first went to him. Brother, in Karbala, they went to him. And when they went to him and asked him questions, they started asking questions, so for every question, he gave the same answer. He was a resident of Karbala. 'I don't know anyone except this one in the dome, I know Hussain, that's all. I don't know anyone else.' Whatever question you ask, 'I don't recognize anyone, I just know them, I know Hussain ibn Ali, I don't know anyone else.' He just gave this answer. So the angels started looking at each other, Nakir and Munkar, that brother, he is giving the same answer for everything. So they were just thinking when a voice came from behind, 'Go, let him go, he is ours. He is ours.' So that's why you should teach the children to do Matam (beating the chest). That's why you should tell them to do Matam (beating the chest) in the grief of Hussain like this, do Zanjeer Zani (flagellation with chains), do Qama Zani (striking the head with a sword), do whatever you want, do Matam (beating the chest) in the grief of Hussain. Encourage the children, take them with you so that they know what our culture is, what our civilization is. And then that scholar says that when the angels were done with him, they came to me. So I said, 'This is a very good formula.' So when they asked, 'Who is your Lord?' 'I don't know anyone except Hussain.' Now whatever question they asked, he said, 'This one also said the same thing, let him go.' So the night of the grave passed very easily. This is a very famous incident of a very great religious scholar. Yes. And the one who narrated this incident, he is also a very great religious scholar, a very great one. Alhamdulillah, we have his recording, that is, video recording, not audio, so that you don't say that, no, and this is before AI. Yes. So you can watch it, it is very old, it is not that it has been created. Send one blessing upon Muhammad. So he says, 'This is our Wilayah (guardianship), there is no exemption in it, no lie, I swear by God,' the Imam says.

### Habib ibn Mazahir al-Asadi: An Exemplar of Loyalty

And you see the same thing in Karbala, that when Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, reached Karbala, he wrote a letter to his childhood friend, Habib.

#### Imam Hussain's (AS) Call for Aid to Habib

Now Habib is sitting at the dinner table, about to eat. Suddenly, someone knocked on the door. He asked, 'Who is it?' He said, 'I am the messenger of Hussain.' 'The messenger of my master!' Habib got up, took the letter, opened it, touched it to his eyes, placed it on his head. It was written in the letter, 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. From Hussain ibn Ali to the jurist, Habib ibn Mazahir al-Asadi.' This letter is from Hussain ibn Ali, for whom? For that jurist, that scholar, that loyal friend, Habib. For him, the letter. 'O Habib, if you are not aware of our situation, then know that we are surrounded by enemies. You know what our relationship is with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. Habib, you are our childhood friend. You are aware of our status and position. We are surrounded by enemies. Habib, if possible, come to our aid.' That's all. Habib read the letter and sat down.

#### Habib's Unwavering Commitment and His Wife's Faith

His wife asked, 'What happened? Whose letter is it?' He said, 'It is the letter of my master, Hussain ibn Ali.' 'What is written?' 'He has called for help. He is surrounded by enemies, Hussain ibn Ali.' 'So what are you thinking?' 'You know how the situation in Kufa is. In such a situation, how can I go to help my master?' The wife said, 'Then you sit at home, I will go to help the son of Fatima.' When Habib had tested his wife, he said, 'O faithful woman, the son of Fatima calls me for help, and I should not go? I was only testing your heart.'

#### The Loyalty of the Horse and Slave

Saying this, Habib got up and called his slave and said to the slave, 'This is my horse. Take it and stand at such and such a place, and from there we have to go to help the grandson of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family.' The slave took the horse and went. He went and stood there. Habib got ready and left. He went, changing lanes. It took him a little while to reach. So what did he see? Tears were flowing from the horse's eyes. The slave was consoling it, 'O loyal horse, do not worry. Even if my master Habib does not come, I will take you to help the son of Fatima.' Habib saw the scene, slapped his face, and said, 'Today, such a time has come at the door of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, that animals are crying, slaves are ready to give their lives.' Habib mounted the horse. Now, after mounting, he said to the slave, 'Go, I have freed you in the way of Allah. I have freed you in the way of Allah.' Now the slave said, 'Habib, this is not fair. As long as you needed my service, you took it. Now when it is time to serve the son of Fatima, you are leaving me behind and going? I will also go with you.' Habib took the slave with him.

#### The Arrival in Karbala and Imam Hussain's (AS) Welcome

Now, when they got close to Karbala, when the dust rose, Hussain understood. Hussain understood that this is Habib ibn Mazahir. He said, 'Get up, get up, my friends, get up. Go and welcome Habib. My childhood friend Habib is coming. Welcome him. My loyal Habib is coming.' Now, when this news gradually reached the tent, Janab Zainab asked Janab Fizza, 'Fizza, ever since we left home, only bad news has been coming. Now what has happened that waves of happiness are spreading?' Fizza went and inquired from the door of the tent. She went out and came back and said, 'O lady, the master's childhood friend Habib has come.'

#### Habib's Humility and the Poetic Conclusion

As soon as Zainab heard Habib's name, she said, 'Fizza, go and give our greetings to Habib. Say, "Habib, you have done a great thing by coming to our aid."' As soon as Fizza conveyed the greetings, Habib threw his turban on the ground of Karbala, sat down, and put dust on his head. 'Today, the situation of the ladies of the house is such that they are sending greetings to slaves like us.' I will say, 'Habib, this is just the beginning of the calamities. When the day of Ashura comes, Hussain will say to Zain al-Abidin, "Son, when you go to Medina, give our greetings. And O my followers, whenever you drink cold water, remember my thirst. And whenever you see a helpless person, remember my helplessness."'

### Conclusion

O Lord, hasten the reappearance of the Imam of our time. O Lord, hasten the reappearance of the Imam of our time. O Lord, hasten the reappearance of the Imam of our time. Count us among his helpers and supporters. Those who are in distress, remove their distress. Those who are in debt, pay off their debts. Those who are childless, grant them righteous and virtuous children. Those who are sick, grant them complete and speedy recovery. The Shias of the Commander of the Faithful, wherever they are in the world, protect their lives, property, honor, and dignity. Protect the great scholars and maraji'. Protect the holy shrines. Protect those who protect them. Grant us the visitation of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad in this world, and the intercession of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad in the hereafter. Matam Hussain.

### üìå Principles and Insights Taught

| Principle Discussed | Concise Summary of Key Point |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| **True Worship and Ma'rifat** | Authentic worship is rooted in profound recognition (Ma'rifat) of the Divine and His appointed Imams. Without this spiritual knowledge, worship lacks true meaning and benefit. |
| **Wilayah as an Essential Pillar** | The guardianship (Wilayah) of the Imams, particularly Imam Ali (AS), is an integral and non-negotiable part of faith, without which other acts of worship may not be accepted. |
| **Historical Patterns of Disobedience** | The Quran and Hadith warn that nations often fail to obey divine commands, especially after the departure of a prophet, mirroring historical patterns of previous communities like the Children of Israel. |
| **Understanding Taqiyyah (Dissimulation)** | Taqiyyah is a divinely sanctioned practice for the preservation of faith and believers, especially in times of severe threat. However, it is forbidden when its practice leads to the destruction of religion itself or the true understanding of Wilayah. |
| **The Unique Status of Ahl al-Bayt (AS)** | The Ahl al-Bayt are servants of Allah, yet possess an exalted status and unique divine light, from whom even angels learn glorification and monotheism. Their virtues are beyond human comprehension, short of attributing divinity to them. |
| **Unwavering Loyalty to the Imam** | Loyalty to the Imam, as exemplified by Habib ibn Mazahir, is an unconditional obligation that extends beyond personal convenience, even prompting devotion from animals and slaves. This loyalty ensures divine intercession and protection. |
| **The Importance of Azadari and Education** | Practicing Matam, Zanjeer Zani, Qama Zani, and educating children about the history of the Ahl al-Bayt and their adversaries are crucial for preserving the faith and ensuring the recognition of the Imams for future generations. |
