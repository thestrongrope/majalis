### Prelude: Laments for the Martyrs of Karbala

#### Lament for Ali Asghar (peace be upon them)

In the name of Allah.
Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them). Mother's beloved, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them). The star of your eyes, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them).
The tents are on fire, the tents are on fire. O my beloved Ali Asghar (peace be upon them).
The mother would say, clinging to the burning cradle, "Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them). Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them)."
The oppressor pulled you out of the grave in such a way... the spear struck your chest... seeing your body, he said, "The head of Akbar (peace be upon them)..."
Alas, alas, Asghar (peace be upon them). The mother would say, clinging to the burning cradle, "Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them)."
Mother's beloved, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them), the star of the eyes, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them).
Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them). The mother would say, clinging to the burning cradle, "Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them). Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them)."
That scene never leaves my eyes, son, the blood kept dripping from your neck. A cloth could not even be tied around your throat. Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them).
The mother would say, clinging to the burning cradle, "Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them). Alas, alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them)."
You kept collecting blood, clinging to your father. Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them).
The mother would say, clinging to the burning cradle, "Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them). Alas, alas, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them)."
Mother's beloved, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them), the star of the eye, Ali Asghar (peace be upon them).
The tent is on fire, O my beloved Ali Asghar (peace be upon them).

#### Lament for Abbas (peace be upon them)

O Abbas (peace be upon them), O Abbas (peace be upon them), O Abbas (peace be upon them). Alas, alas, Abbas (peace be upon them).
O Abbas (peace be upon them), O Abbas (peace be upon them), O Abbas (peace be upon them). Alas, alas, Abbas (peace be upon them).
In a foreign land, Hussain's (peace be upon them) settlement was ruined. Ghazi, after you, it was قیامت (calamity).
When the support of the pure ones did not return from the river, the children of Fatima (peace be upon them), the universe of Zahra (peace be upon them), were scattered in the desert.
Ghazi, after you, it was قیامت (calamity). Alas, Abbas (peace be upon them), O Abbas (peace be upon them), alas, Abbas (peace be upon them).
Alas, alas, Abbas (peace be upon them). Abbas (peace be upon them), alas, Abbas (peace be upon them).
O Abbas (peace be upon them), O Abbas (peace be upon them), alas, alas, Abbas (peace be upon them).
Your beloved Sakina (peace be upon them) is enduring sorrows. Since you have gone, Ghazi, she calls for you. She does not sleep in peace, she is so frightened.
Ghazi, after you, it was قیامت (calamity). In a foreign land, Hussain's (peace be upon them) settlement was ruined. Ghazi, after you, it was قیامت (calamity).

### Commencement of the Discourse

أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ السَّمِيعِ الْعَلِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ
I seek refuge in Allah, the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing, from the accursed Satan.
بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيمِ

Blessings and peace be upon the noblest of the prophets and messengers, the beloved of the God of the worlds, Abu al-Qasim Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy family).
اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.

### The Importance of Worship and Gnosis

#### Hadith from Imam Hussain (peace be upon them)

أَمَّا بَعْدُ، فَقَدْ قَالَ مَوْلَانَا وَسَيِّدُنَا الْحُسَيْنُ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ: مَنْ عَبَدَ اللَّهَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِهِ، آتَاهُ اللَّهُ فَوْقَ أَمَانِيِّهِ وَكِفَايَتِهِ
As to what follows, our master and leader, Hussain (peace be upon him), said: 'Whoever worships Allah as He deserves to be worshipped, Allah will grant him more than his wishes and needs.'
- [Reference needed]

صَدَقَ مَوْلَانَا الْحُسَيْنُ ابْنُ عَلِيٍّ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامُ
Our master, Hussain ibn Ali (peace be upon them), has spoken the truth.

صلواة
Blessings.
اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.

Sayyid al-Shuhada (the Master of Martyrs) (peace be upon them) states in this noble hadith that "مَنْ عَبَدَ اللَّهَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِهِ" (Whoever worships Allah as He deserves to be worshipped), Allah will grant him more than his aspirations and his needs. The discussion was about worship and gnosis, about the station of Imamate, the position of Imamate, and the reality of Imamate.

#### The Significance of Wilayat and Imamate

Yesterday, it was submitted to you that this Wilayat (guardianship), this Imamate, and this adherence to the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) is so important that the more one discusses its significance, the less it is. It is essential to keep the Sha'a'ir (symbols) of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) alive. Sha'a'ir means symbols, signs, and emblems.

### Honoring the Symbols of Allah (Sha'a'ir Allah)

The Quran itself has said:
وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ شَعَائِرَ اللَّهِ فَإِنَّهَا مِن تَقْوَى الْقُلُوبِ
And whoever honors the symbols of Allah - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts.
- [Quran, Surah Al-Hajj, 22:32]

This shows how pure a person's heart is. And it is evident that a Muslim considers that camel which is sacrificed in Mecca during Hajj as a symbol, considers those mountains as symbols, considers those stones as symbols, considers everything as a symbol. But when it comes to the progeny of the Messenger (peace be upon him and his holy family), all sorts of questions are raised.

#### Azadari as a Symbol of Piety

Among these symbols is this symbol of Azadari (mourning). This Azadari is that sign, that symbol, which reveals a person's purity; it shows how pure his heart is, how pure his birth is. The more a person keeps this worship, this Azadari, alive and tries as much as possible to keep it alive, and spends as much as possible for it, remember that the more one spends, the more one will receive. Never think that we have spent a lot. This thought should never enter the mind that we have spent a lot in the way of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them). Whatever is spent, always consider it to be less.

And often people say that they are ready to sell their houses, and indeed their passion is such that they are ready to sell their houses for the sake of Imam Hussain (peace be upon them). But we have never seen Hussain (peace be upon them) let anyone sell their house. We have never seen that. Hussain (peace be upon them) has always helped as much as was needed, for the one who spends for the sake of Hussain (peace be upon them).

#### Spending in the Way of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them)

Now, I will narrate a few hadiths and traditions to you, that there is no better spending than spending in the way of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them). First, I will narrate the hadith, and then I will also present the objection that is often raised, so that it becomes clear how people object. They say, "Why do you spend so much? Why do you spend so much?" First, listen to the hadith, the objection will come later. All the hadiths that I am reciting to you are from the book Al-Kafi and are all authentic traditions.

##### Comparison of Spending: Imamate vs. Other Good Deeds

The first hadith, in which the sixth Imam, Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them), says:
اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.

دِرْهَمٌ يُوصَلُ بِهِ الْإِمَامُ
A dirham which connects one to the Imam
- [Reference needed - Al-Kafi]

is better than two hundred thousand dirhams spent in other good deeds. That is, one dirham spent for the sake of the Imam cannot be compared to two hundred thousand dirhams if someone gives it for other good deeds. Therefore, never compare. The common objection is that you spend so much, instead you should build schools, hospitals, do this and that. All these are good things. Schools should be built, hospitals should be built, many things should be done. Build housing, hospitals, medical facilities, do everything. All are very good things. But from your own budget, not from the budget of Imam Hussain (peace be upon them). Do not think of taking from the budget of Imam Hussain (peace be upon them) to build a school or hospital. Keep it separate. Do not count it together. These are two separate things, and they cannot be compared.

Look, we are emphasizing again, schools should be built, hospitals should be built, other good deeds should be done. But all these things will have importance only when Wilayat (guardianship) is alive. If you train a doctor or an engineer without Wilayat, tomorrow this same doctor and engineer will become a godless doctor and a godless engineer. There is no benefit from such a doctor or engineer. There is no benefit from an educationist who does not have Wilayat, who does not have religion, who does not have the belief in Imamate. What is the use? If you ask him to train some children, he says, "I don't believe in all this, for me, everyone is equal." Fine, then make them equal. Then Allah also has a way of making things equal, remember that.

So, "وُجُوهِ الْبِرِّ" (ways of righteousness), spending two hundred thousand dirhams on good deeds, and one dirham for Azadari, for the sake of the Imam, there is no comparison.

##### The Immense Virtue of Dirhams for the Imam

Now look at the second hadith, what Imam Sajjad (peace be upon them) says:
اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.

يَا مَيَّاحُ
O Mayyah,
- [Reference needed - Al-Kafi]

the narrator's name is Mayyah. The Imam says, "A dirham that you spend to connect with your Imam is greater in weight than the mountain of Uhud." The mountain of Uhud cannot equal it in weight. This one dirham that you are spending. Look at the virtue.

Look at the third hadith. We are narrating all these hadiths to you because narrating these hadiths is also "إِحْيَاءُ أَمْرِنَا" (reviving our cause). The Imam says, "Narrate our hadiths, convey our hadiths to the people, because through this our cause is revived." And in another hadith, the Imam says, "Convey our hadiths to the people. If people recognize the beauty of our hadiths, they would surely follow us." So narrate our hadiths to the people. When you narrate our hadiths, they will know what is truth and what is falsehood, what is right and what is wrong. Because:
اعرفوا الله بالله، والرسول بالرسالة، وأولي الأمر بالأمر بالمعروف والعدل والإحسان
Know Allah through Allah, the Messenger through the message, and the possessors of authority through [their] enjoining of good, justice, and kindness.
- [Reference needed]

You recognize the Messenger through his message. This is the Messenger, then you say, yes, this is a true messenger because his message, the things he is saying, are leading us towards Allah. His words do not make us worldly. His words remind us of Allah. The words of this Messenger remind us of the Day of Judgment. The words of this Messenger make us religious, they lead us towards worship. So, "الرسول بالرسالة" (the Messenger by the message). And how do you recognize the possessor of authority? "بِالْعَدْلِ وَالْإِحْسَانِ" (by justice and kindness). When the Imam speaks, he will speak of justice and kindness. This is how you recognize the Imam. That is why there is so much emphasis in the traditions to narrate our hadiths, so that people may recognize us. But what happened in history? People were kept away from the hadiths, with the excuse that we cannot understand them, it is not our job to understand them. Why won't we understand? The Imams (peace be upon them) have told us for our understanding.

So, look at the third hadith I am presenting to you. The narrator says that he heard Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them) saying this: "The thing that Allah loves the most is the spending of dirhams for the Imam." For this Azadari, for these sacred offerings. And then he says, "Allah will make one dirham in Paradise equal to the mountain of Uhud." One dirham. Imagine the reward.

##### Understanding "A Goodly Loan" (Qardhan Hasana) to Allah

After that, the Imam says that Allah says:
مَّن ذَا الَّذِي يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا
Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan?
- [Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:245 and others]

Now, focus on the words. What does "قَرْضًا حَسَنًا" (a goodly loan) mean? A goodly loan is a loan that is given with the intention, and the one who takes it also takes it with the intention, of returning it. Because interest is not allowed in Islam. Usually, interest is not allowed. Therefore, the person who is taking a loan, what should he do? When he is taking a "قَرْضًا حَسَنًا" (goodly loan), an interest-free loan from someone, when he returns it, he should give a little extra. This is the law, a simple basic law. Not that there is pressure on him for interest, just a little extra, for example, as a token of appreciation, that you helped me in my difficult time.

Here, Allah says in the Quran that if someone gives to the Imam, it is as if he has given a goodly loan to Allah. Allah is taking it with the intention of a goodly loan, that Allah will return it. But how much will Allah return? He is also clarifying that. He will give it back many times over. Now, "many times over," how much does that mean? Millions of times. When Allah says "many times over," look, whenever someone speaks, the statement is judged by the speaker. Remember this. Look, I am giving a very simple example. The statement is judged by the speaker. A small person who has nothing, if he says, "Brother, if you help me with this, I will also do something for you," it comes to your mind that this poor fellow is in such a state himself, what can he do for me? But okay, he is saying it. But if a great person says it, a thought comes to mind that this great person is saying this at this time. For example, he is on a journey, say he went for Hajj, and there he has some problem. He says to a person there, "You help me, I am a very big man in India. I will help you many times more than you are helping me." Then the one who is helping thinks that if I give him, for example, a dinar, what will he give me? A thousand dinars, three thousand, five thousand. Why? Because he is measuring it according to that person's status. Now, when the speaker is Allah Himself, then this is the Being who is infinite in His infinity. Subhanallah (Glory be to God). Who is infinite in His being infinite. Limitless in His being limitless. So when He makes a promise, when He gives, He will give so much, so much that there is no account of it. What is the only condition? The condition should be sincerity. The condition is only that a person acts with sincerity. Look, there is nothing else besides this.

### Sincerity in Service to the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them)

#### Avoiding the Perception of Favoritism

And in this, another important thing I would like to present to you is that the thought should never come to a person's mind that the Imam needs my money, or that I am doing a favor to the religion. That by holding Azadari, I am doing a favor to Imam Hussain (peace be upon them). That by arranging a Majlis (gathering), I am doing a favor. No one is doing any favor. Rather, if Imam Hussain (peace be upon them) accepts, if the Princess (Zahra) (peace be upon them) accepts, then she is doing a favor to us. If Imam Hussain (peace be upon them) accepts, this is a favor upon us. Wow, wow, wow.

Whenever we distribute Tabarruk (sacred food), we should never think that by distributing Tabarruk we are doing a great favor, a great deed. And that is why if someone comes and says, "Look, based on our experience, we are telling you all these things," that "Brother, give me two," you should give him two. If he is asking for two, of course, the one who is asking should also think that others should get it first, then take two or three, but that is a different matter. But never think that if we gave him two, we did a favor to him. Why? That too, I will present to you. It is possible that this thought came to his heart too, that he is asking for double, that we are being tested whether we give or not. Wow, wow, wow. Therefore, never even think about Tabarruk that we are doing a favor. That, for example, instead of food, we could have distributed this, it would have been better. Distributed two jalebis, two of whatever people distribute. No, but every person should do according to his capacity, as Allah has made him capable. Look, it is not that if someone distributed a bigger thing, Allah will accept it, the Imam will accept it, and if someone who did not have money distributed something small, it will not be accepted. It is not like that. Whatever one does, one should do it with sincerity. The only thing that is traded with the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) is sincerity. Wealth is not traded there. It is just that a person should never think that he is doing a favor to the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them).

The Quran has also spoken about this:
لَا تَمُنُّوا عَلَيَّ إِسْلَامَكُم
Do not consider your Islam a favor to me.
- [Quran, Surah Al-Hujurat, 49:17]

You have become Muslims, rather Allah has done a favor to you. That He gave you this grace that you became Muslims. So today, if we have been given the grace of this Azadari, then this is a grace from Allah. Not everyone is destined for it. This Wilayat, Allah distributes it after seeing. Wow, wow. He does not give it to everyone. Do not think that it is just being distributed like that. No, no, He distributes it after seeing. And look, I will also present a hadith to you about this, that not only this, but Allah first purifies his lineage, that is, He purifies his birth, then He gives him Azadari. These are all strange things.

#### The Imam's Self-Sufficiency and Divine Grace

Look, if someone presumes, this is also a narration from Al-Kafi, the Imam, the sixth Imam, Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them), says: "Whoever presumes that the Imam is in need of what is in the hands of the people, what the people have, that the Imam is in need of it, he has gone out of the circle of religion." That is, this feeling of neediness, when does it arise? When we think that by holding this Majlis, we have done a favor to Imam Hussain (peace be upon them). By holding this Azadari, we have done a favor to Imam Hussain (peace be upon them). By keeping this Tabarruk, we have done a favor to Imam Hussain (peace be upon them). No one is doing any favor. No one is doing any favor.

Now listen further. "النَّاسُ يَحْتَاجُونَ" (The people are in need). The people are in need. For what? That the Imam accepts this Azadari of theirs. The people are in need, the people are needy, that the Imam accepts. "قَالَ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ" (Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, said), and Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, says in the Quran, the Imam is supporting his statement with the Quran, supporting it with a verse from the Quran. He says:
خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً
Take, [O, Muhammad], from their wealth a charity.
- [Quran, Surah At-Tawbah, 9:103]

Charity, for example, charity, that is, what they give with sincerity. It is not charity in the sense of the charity that is given away. No, here charity means spending. After that, what is the sentence?
تُطَهِّرُهُمْ وَتُزَكِّيهِم بِهَا
by which you purify them and cause them to increase.
- [Quran, Surah At-Tawbah, 9:103]

If you have taken it, accepted it, through it you have purified them and their deeds are accepted. This is a sign of the purity of lineage. The Imam is explaining through the Quran. Therefore, no one should have this pride or this thought. As much as possible. And what is this small amount that we spend? What is its value? What is its status?

### Examples of Unwavering Loyalty and Sacrifice

Oh, the lovers of the Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon them) were such that they gave their lives, and they gave their lives smiling. I have presented the example of Janab Rashid before you, the example of Janab Maytham. Today, I present to you the example of another lover of the Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon them).

#### The Story of Janab Qambar

And who is he? Janab Qambar. Qambar is the slave of the Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon them). Janab Qambar has a very high station and a very great rank. Do not consider Janab Qambar to be small. Do not take Janab Qambar lightly. He is a slave. But look at his rank. I submit to you that Janab Qambar's life was very long. He was alive until the time of Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi, may Allah's curse be upon him. Hajjaj was that devil, who was truly a devil. Satan was a partner in his birth.

The verse in Surah Bani Isra'il. There is a verse in Surah Bani Isra'il, in which, that is, verse number 64:
وَشَارِكْهُمْ فِي الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَوْلَادِ
and be a partner in their wealth and children.
- [Quran, Surah Al-Isra, 17:64]

The permission that Allah gave to Satan, in that permission, what did Allah say? "You become a partner in the wealth and children of these people." So, the one in whose children Satan is a partner, he is not legitimate. He cannot be legitimate because Satan is a partner. Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi was one in whose birth Satan was a partner. This is found in our traditions.

##### Qambar's Encounter with Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi

So this devil, this Hajjaj, one day, what did he say? He said, "Today I am in the mood. My mood today is to kill a lover of Ali, so that through him I may attain closeness to Allah." Look at the devil, what he is. "Kill a lover of Ali." So the people, the sycophants around him, they said, "Qambar." That is, they said, "Among the lovers of Ali, the one who was closest to Ali and is still alive is Qambar. He loved Ali the most and is still alive." Hajjaj said, "Call him." He was called.

Hajjaj asked, the accursed one said, "Are you Qambar?" He said, "Yes, I am Qambar." He said, "Is your kunya (patronymic) Abu Hamdan?" That is, he was confirming. He said, "Yes." Now, look at his question. "Who is your master?" The slave of Ali ibn Abi Talib (the Commander of the Faithful) (peace be upon them). Now, listen to Qambar's answer. Look, this is what happens to one who stays at the door of the Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon them). He becomes as eloquent and articulate as the Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon them) trained him to be. And no one can shut this tongue. The one whom the Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon them) has taught to speak, no power in the world has the strength to silence him. Now, this Hajjaj is a great tyrant. In front of him, even the best became silent. If I were to present examples to you, you would be astonished.

Qambar said, "Allah is my master." Hajjaj said, "So you are the slave of Ali?" Because in Arabic, when the word "mawla" comes, "mawla" has two meanings: slave and master. So he said, "You are the slave of Ali?" Qambar replied, "Allah is my master, my God, and Amir al-Mu'minin Ali (the Commander of the Faithful) (peace be upon them) is my Wali al-Ni'mah (guardian of blessings), whom Allah has chosen." What does this mean? "Allah is my master, my God, and Allah has chosen Ali (the Commander of the Faithful) (peace be upon them) so that through them I may receive blessings." Wow, wow.

##### Qambar's Steadfastness and Martyrdom

When Hajjaj heard this, he went mad. He understood what he was trying to say. So Hajjaj gave the order, "Renounce the religion of Ali. Express your disassociation." Qambar said, "I will." Qambar said, "I will, but show me a religion better than Ali's. Show me a religion better than Ali's, so that I can do this." Hajjaj said, "You will not do it?" Qambar said, "No." Hajjaj then asked, "Do you know the consequence? Choose your own method of death. Choose your own method of death." Qambar replied, "I leave that in your hands. Kill me as you wish." Hajjaj said, "Why are you saying this?" Qambar said, "Because my master said that the one who kills you, on the Day of Judgment, you will kill him in the same manner." Hajjaj asked, "What did your master say about how you will be killed?" Qambar said, "My master said that the one who kills you will slaughter you, he will cut you into pieces." Hajjaj then said, "Then I will kill you in the same way." And he killed Qambar, slaughtered him. As an animal is slaughtered, so was Qambar slaughtered by him. This was a lover of the Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon them).

And remember, at that time, it was not the passion of youth, but at that time Qambar was very old. Qambar was very old at that time, but there was not the slightest bit of fear.

#### The Sacrifice of Janab Umm Khalid

And in the same way, there were women too. Janab Umm Khalid was in the time of Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them). The governor of Baghdad asked her, "Do you want to go for Ziyarat (pilgrimage)?" He said, "I will cut off one of your hands." She said, "Cut it off." One hand was cut off. The second time, he threatened again, and her other hand was also cut off. Despite this, when it came to renouncing her faith, Janab Umm Khalid never backed down. She did not back down in the slightest, that she would be scared, what would she do, how would it be, what would happen. No. Her story is very famous. She had her hands cut off. She used to go to the class of Abu Basir, she was a student of Abu Basir. Look, this address is to the ladies, that how much sacrifice she was ready to make in the path of religion. She did not back down in the slightest. So these are all tests of Wilayat. At such times, it is seen how much Wilayat one has, and how much one does not. Otherwise, for talking, many people talk.

So when will this matter become clear? When a person is connected to the Imam, connected to the Imam. Through this Azadari, a person, look, in the hadiths that we read, there was one common word, if you noticed, those who are familiar with Arabic, the word was "silah." What does "silah" mean? It comes from "wasl." What does "wasl" mean? Connection. That is, whoever is connected to the Imam, his existence becomes illuminated. His existence becomes completely illuminated. Why? Because the Imam is light, Imamate is light.

### Imamate as Divine Light (An-Nur)

#### Quranic Command to Believe in the Light

Now look, what is the narration? This is a verse from the Quran:
فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَالنُّورِ الَّذِي أَنزَلْنَا
So believe in Allah and His Messenger and the light which We have sent down.
- [Quran, Surah At-Taghabun, 64:8]

Belief in three things is being talked about: believe in Allah, that's one thing. Believe in His Messenger, and in that light. The third thing is light. Now, when you talk about light, if you ask any Muslim, what does this mean? That the Quran is light. Hey, when you believe in the Messenger, you will believe in the Quran anyway. Show me one Muslim who believes in the Messenger but not in the Quran. Have you seen any such Muslim? Tell me, yes, we have seen one who believes in the Messenger but not in the Quran. No. But yes, we have met many such Muslims who believe in the Messenger but do not believe in the successor of the Messenger. They do not believe in that light which is called Ali ibn Abi Talib (the Commander of the Faithful) (peace be upon them). They do not believe in that Imam who is appointed by Allah. So Allah is emphasizing, if you believe in the Messenger, then along with the Messenger, also believe in this Ali whom We have sent down with him. Recognize this descent of Ali ibn Abi Talib (the Commander of the Faithful) (peace be upon them). Recognize Ali ibn Abi Talib (the Commander of the Faithful) (peace be upon them). Recognize the infallible Imams (peace be upon them). What is their rank, what is their station?

#### The Incomparable Nature of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them)

And that is why it has been said again and again in the narrations, and in the books of virtues, the books of hadith, in the fourth century, many of our hadith scholars wrote many books with the title "Fada'il Amir al-Mu'minin" (Virtues of the Commander of the Faithful), and in these books, they narrated hadiths that no one can compare with the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them). No non-infallible can compare with the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them). Remember this. That is why they are light. And whatever is inherently darkness and gloom, it cannot compete with that which is inherently light. Perhaps the point has not reached you. Light and darkness can never be compared. The entire universe, in comparison to the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them), is darkness, gloom. The universe was illuminated by the light of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them). If the light of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) were not there, or if the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) were to take back their light, then this universe would again become dark. So the Imam says that this light is what? "النُّورُ هُوَ الْإِمَامُ" (The light is the Imam). This is the light that the Quran is emphasizing.

There can be no equality.
هَلْ يَسْتَوِي الَّذِينَ يَعْلَمُونَ وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ
Are those who know equal to those who do not know?
- [Quran, Surah Az-Zumar, 39:9]

Can the knowledgeable and the ignorant be equal? The one who is the embodiment of knowledge, who is knowledge personified, whom Allah has sent as knowledge, can he be compared with people who are inherently ignorant and take their knowledge from the Imam? Can there be a comparison? No, there cannot be.

Now look at the next hadith. Recite another Salawat on Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.
اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.

#### The Imams as the Light of Heavens and Earth

Pay close attention to this hadith. Look, it is a very important thing. Abu Khalid al-Kabuli, whom we mentioned yesterday, who was Abu Khalid al-Kabuli? What a personality he was. He was from Afghanistan. He says that he heard from Imam Baqir (peace be upon them), that the Imam said, "Believe in Allah, believe in the Messenger, and believe in the light that We have sent down." So the Imam says, "O Khalid, by Allah, this light is the progeny of Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy family), who will remain until the Day of Judgment. This is that light. By Allah, this is the light that Allah has sent down. By Allah, the progeny of Muhammad (peace be upon them) are the light of the heavens and the earth."
- [Reference needed - Al-Kafi]

What does "the light of the heavens and the earth" mean? That is, the heavens and the earth, which are illuminated, which exist, are because of the progeny of Muhammad (peace be upon them). If the progeny of Muhammad (peace be upon them) were not there, the heavens and the earth could not be illuminated. They would be destroyed. And as will happen after the blowing of the trumpet by Israfil, everything will be destroyed except the "Face of Allah." Except for the "Face of Allah," everything will be destroyed. Or everything will perish, only the "Face of the Lord" will remain. What does this mean? What is this destruction? What is this perishing? What is this annihilation? What does it mean? The Imam says, "We are the Face of Allah who will remain." Only their existence will remain. Their existence will remain. Everything else will perish. Everything will be annihilated. Light will be taken from everything.

#### The Light of Imamate in the Hearts of Believers

And after that, he says, "By Allah, O Khalid, the light of the Imam in the hearts of the believers is brighter than the light of the sun." Allahu Akbar (God is the greatest). It is brighter than the light of the sun, which is in the hearts of the believers. Now, this depends on how firm our belief is. The firmer the belief, the brighter this light. The more we remember the Imam, the more this light. The closer we are to the hadiths, the more this light. Otherwise, if we are far from the Imam, from their teachings, yes, if we have belief, it is a great thing. And we should have belief, even if it is little. Even if it is little. Look, a lamp, no matter how little light it gives, will be called a lamp. No matter how little light it gives, it will be called a lamp. And who knows when Allah's grace will come, when Allah will increase its light.

That is why bring your children to these Majalis, so that through these Majalis, and just as in the days of happiness, when there are gatherings, take them to those gatherings, so that the children understand what is the happiness of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) and what is the sorrow of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them). And this is the sign of being a Shia. This is the sign of religion. As Imam Zaman (may Allah hasten his noble reappearance) himself says in his words, "Our Shias are created from our clay, from the remainder of our clay. They rejoice when we are happy, and they grieve when we are sad." This is the sign of a Shia. When the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) are happy, the Shia is happy. When the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) are sad, the Shia is sad.

### The Significance of the Title "Rafidi"

Do not worry. If someone calls you a "Rafidi," remember that this title "Rafidi" is a very important title. It is not a bad title. Many of our ignorant people, who are not familiar with the narrations, who are not familiar with the hadiths, they take offense. "Don't call us Rafidi, we are Shia." No, no, the title "Rafidi" is above "Shia." "Shia" means one who follows, who follows. And "Rafidi" is one who rejects the enemies of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them), who distances himself from them. This requires courage. It is not for everyone to be a Rafidi.

#### Historical Context and True Meaning

And that is why it was the time of the Abbasids, there was a judge, and that judge was sitting. Obviously, you know, they were all enemies of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them).

#### The Story of Ammar Duhni

Among them, a lover of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) was brought, "This is a witness." His name was Ammar Duhni. Now when Ammar Duhni was brought, as soon as the judge saw Ammar, he said, he knew, because Ammar was a very capable man, a very learned man, a hadith scholar. So seeing him, he said, "Ammar, we accept your testimony, but you have only one problem, that you are a Rafidi. That is why we do not accept your testimony. We reject your testimony because in our school of thought," listen, you are not listening, "in our school of thought, the testimony of Rafidis is not accepted." As soon as Ammar Duhni heard this, he started crying loudly. So the judge explained, "Ammar, why are you crying? Change your school of thought, leave Rafidism, and we will accept your testimony. No problem." Ammar said, he spoke with great respect, Ammar used slightly harsh words, he said, "I am not crying because you are not accepting my testimony." He addressed the judge, "I am not crying because you are not accepting my testimony. I am crying because you have given me such a great title, 'Rafidi'." Subhanallah (Glory be to God). "I do not consider myself worthy of being honored with such a great title, of being bestowed with such a great title." So "Rafidi" is a very great title, and a very great station. And if someone calls you a Rafidi, remember that this is the title that was given in the time of Prophet Musa (peace be upon him) to those who rejected the people of falsehood. They were given this title. The enemies gave it. But the enemies gave it, but Allah liked that title so much that Allah said to the angels, "Preserve this title. Preserve this title. In the last days, when the lovers of Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy family) come, when they reject falsehood, then give them this title." So this title "Rafidi" is a very important title. It is not used for everyone.

Recite a Salawat on Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.
اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.

The Imam says, "By Allah, the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them), the Imam, they are the ones who illuminate the hearts of the believers. And Allah, from whom He wills, He conceals this light of Wilayat, He hides it. He does not give it to everyone. He does not give it to everyone, that you think it is something being distributed on the road. No. Therefore, what happens is that their souls, their hearts, become dark, they become gloomy, they become black. Their hearts are not illuminated." We are trying not to use too much Urdu and Arabic so that the children can understand. That is why we are using English words. Look, these are all things that everyone should know. These are all hadiths that everyone should know. You should understand these as hadiths, because narrating stories will not do justice to the Majlis. Justice to the Majlis will be done when narrations, when hadiths are narrated.

### Wilayat as Protection from Severe Reckoning

Now the Imam says, "O Khalid," now the Imam swears by Allah, he says, "Abu Khalid, no one will love us and accept our Wilayat until Allah purifies his heart, until Allah purifies his soul. And Allah will not purify the soul and heart of any servant until he completely submits to us, completely submits, that whatever the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) have said, just accept it, nothing else. Whatever the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) have said, if the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) have said it is day, then it is day. If the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) have said it is night, then it is night. Just completely accept it.

#### The Condition for Divine Protection: Complete Submission

And he submits to us and does not fight with us. And when he completely submits to us and does not fight with us, Allah will protect him from the severe reckoning." On the Day of Judgment, when there will be a severe reckoning, everyone else will have a severe reckoning. So this verse that came, that whoever does one good deed, he will be held accountable for it, and whoever does one evil deed, he will be held accountable for it. "يَرَهُ" (he will see it) means he will see it, meaning he will have to give an account for it. He will have to give an account for it. These are the verses of Surah Zilzal, that whoever does one good deed will have to give an account for that one good deed. Whoever does one evil deed will have to give an account for it. His reckoning will be very severe. These are the people who left the Wilayat of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) and went away. And whoever is connected to the Wilayat of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them), who has held on to it, Allah will save him from the severe reckoning through this light. Those who submit to the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them), for them there will be no such reckoning. The Imam is saying. Yes, brother, if someone has an objection to our statement, then go and read the hadith. If he has an objection to the hadith, then we have no quarrel with him. If he has an objection to the hadith, then we have no quarrel with such a person. Then there is no issue at all.

#### Deliverance from "Faza' al-Akbar" (The Greatest Fear)

And then after that, the Imam says, "Allah will protect him on the Day of Judgment from the 'Faza' al-Akbar'." What is "Faza' al-Akbar"? "Faza'" means fear, terror. And "Akbar" means the greatest. That is, the fear on the Day of Judgment will be the greatest fear. There will be no fear greater than it, no terror greater than it. That is, this is a stage of the Day of Judgment, "Faza' al-Akbar." How many stages are there on the Day of Judgment? 50 stages. How many years will each stage be? A thousand years. How many days will the Day of Judgment last? 50,000 years. The Quran says that one day with your Lord is equal to fifty thousand years. What is this 50,000 years? This is the Day of Judgment, which will be equal to 50,000 years. In it, one stage of the Day of Judgment is "Faza' al-Akbar." What is "Faza' al-Akbar"? "Faza' al-Akbar" is the day of the greatest fear. What will that day be like? Read the hadiths, you will find the hadith that on that day, there will be darkness all around, and people will be so scared, they will sweat so much, they will sweat so much in "Faza' al-Akbar" that the sweat will flow, flow, flow past their knees and reach here. Now, do not think that, oh, then there will be weight loss. This will happen, that will happen. No, at that time, the condition will be very bad. The condition will not be good at that time. The condition will be very bad. There will be a lot of fear. And it is found in the hadith, and this is also taken from a verse of the Quran, Insha'Allah (God willing), we will explain it to you tomorrow, that in it too, only he will be saved. Only he will be saved who has held on to the cloak of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them). He who has held the cloak of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) firmly, only he will be saved.

### The Call for Adherence to the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them)

That is why, look, this adherence to the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) is a very important thing. We are emphasizing it again and again. Because no matter how much we emphasize, it is not enough. Because the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) spent his whole life speaking, speaking, speaking, so what is our capacity, what is our status? We are just presenting these things to you for a few days. The Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) spent his whole life speaking, that:
مَا إِنْ تَمَسَّكْتُمْ بِهِمَا لَنْ تَضِلُّوا بَعْدِي أَبَدًا
as long as you hold fast to them, you will never go astray after me.
- [Reference needed - Hadith of Thaqalayn]

If you hold firmly to the Quran and the cloak of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them), you will never go astray after me. But what did the Ummah (community) do? The Ummah left the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them). Imam Zaman (peace be upon them) says in his supplication, "How the Ummah united to cut off ties with the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) and made their children wander from place to place." "إِلَّا الْقَلِيلَ" (except for a few). Very few people were there who truly fulfilled the covenant. The rest all left the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them). And that is why Karbala happened. Otherwise, Karbala would not have happened. If the Ummah had adhered to the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them), Karbala would not have happened.

### Narration of the Martyrdom of Qasim ibn Hassan (peace be upon them)

Tonight is the seventh night, and this is the night when a 13-year-old youth is mentioned. This 13-year-old youth, and this is the child who was very eagerly waiting for death.

#### Qasim's Eagerness for Martyrdom

Sayyid al-Shuhada (peace be upon them) asked, "Son Qasim, how is death to you?" Qasim (peace be upon them) replied, "It is sweeter than honey."

#### The Amulet and Permission for Battle

Now, on the night of Ashura, Hussain (peace be upon them) recited the list of martyrs. He took the name of each and every martyr, but he did not mention Qasim's (peace be upon them) name. The child went to a corner and started crying. While crying, a thought suddenly came to him that when his father was leaving this world, he had tied an amulet on his arm and said, "Son Qasim, when a great calamity befalls you, open this amulet." Now when Qasim (peace be upon them) opened the amulet, what was written in it? "My son Qasim, help your uncle Hussain (peace be upon them). When your uncle falls among the enemies, help your uncle." As soon as Qasim (peace be upon them) read this amulet, he started smiling and came and handed his father's writing to his uncle. As soon as Hussain (peace be upon them) saw the writing, he read his brother's writing, tears came from his eyes. He looked at Qasim (peace be upon them) from head to toe and said, "Qasim, your name was also in the list of martyrs. I just did not mention it. Everyone has to be martyred. And Qasim, not only your name, but in the list of martyrs, your brother Ali Asghar's (peace be upon them) name is also there."

Now, where Qasim (peace be upon them) was happy on one hand that his name was in the list of martyrs, hearing the name of Ali Asghar (peace be upon them), the honorable child of Bani Hashim was agitated. He said, "Will the enemies come into the tents?" Hussain (peace be upon them) consoled him, "No, Qasim, I will take Ali Asghar (peace be upon them) in my own hands." Now, "I will take Ali Asghar (peace be upon them) in my own hands," Qasim's (peace be upon them) heart was consoled that the enemies would not go into the tents. I will say with folded hands, "O honorable one of Bani Hashim, just this thought that the enemies would come into the tents, and you were agitated. Oh, ask Sayyid Sajjad (peace be upon them) further, on the tenth of Ashura, the enemies are coming into the tents. Sayyid Sajjad (peace be upon them) is seeing the whole scene with his own eyes."

The afternoon of the tenth of Ashura passed. Now the day of Ashura came. The companions were martyred. After noon, the series of sacrifices of Bani Hashim began. Once, when it was the turn of the children of Hassan (peace be upon them), Qasim (peace be upon them) came and stood in front of Hussain (peace be upon them). And in that writing, it was also written, "Son Qasim, even if your uncle does not give permission, you should keep insisting until your uncle gives permission." Now Qasim (peace be upon them) came and stood, "Uncle, give me permission. Uncle, give me permission." Now, I will narrate a sentence from the Maqtal (account of the martyrdom) to you. I could not bear it. It is written in the Maqtal that when Hussain (peace be upon them) was just looking at Qasim (peace be upon them), unable to give permission, once Qasim (peace be upon them) took both of Hussain's (peace be upon them) hands and started rubbing his eyes on Hussain's (peace be upon them) hands. "Uncle, give me permission. Uncle, give me permission." Hussain (peace be upon them) hugged Qasim (peace be upon them) and said, "Son, I have given you permission. Come, today is the day of everyone's wish. Everyone has to die." He gave permission to Qasim (peace be upon them).

Now he came, prepared Qasim (peace be upon them). After preparing him, both uncle and nephew embraced and cried in such a way, cried in such a way, cried so much, cried so much that both fainted. O mourners, tell me with justice, if someone faints today, what is done to bring him back to consciousness? Water is sprinkled. Alas, Zainab Kubra (peace be upon them), look at Zainab's (peace be upon them) helplessness. Oh, where to bring water from? Tears were sprinkled. The uncle and nephew both regained consciousness. He said, "Brother, now give permission to Qasim (peace be upon them)." Hussain (peace be upon them) seated Qasim (peace be upon them) on the horse, but while leaving, he once tore Qasim's (peace be upon them) collar. He said, "Uncle, what is this?" He said, "This is the sign of orphans. This is the symbol of orphans. Go, son."

#### Qasim's Final Moments and Hussain's (peace be upon them) Grief

Now Qasim (peace be upon them) went. Qasim (peace be upon them) went and fought, fought, fought. While fighting, once it is written in the Maqtal that someone shot such an arrow that when Qasim (peace be upon them) fell from the horse, he fell in such a way that one of his feet got stuck in the stirrup of the horse. It got stuck in such a way that now Qasim (peace be upon them), hanging on the horse, the horse took Qasim (peace be upon them) among the enemies. The enemies started cutting Qasim (peace be upon them) with their swords. After that, they ran horses over his body. They started running horses over the weak body of this 13-year-old. In his weak voice, Qasim (peace be upon them) called out, "O uncle, accept my last salam (greeting)." Hussain (peace be upon them) came to Qasim's (peace be upon them) body. He came to Qasim's (peace be upon them) body. But how did Hussain (peace be upon them) bring Qasim's (peace be upon them) body to the tent? My heart does not allow me to narrate it. Just listen to one sentence from the Maqtal. Just listen to one sentence. Hussain (peace be upon them) collected the pieces of Qasim's (peace be upon them) body in his cloak.

### Concluding Supplication

O Lord, hasten the reappearance of Imam Zaman (peace be upon them). O Lord, hasten the reappearance of Imam Zaman (peace be upon them).

O Allah, be, for Your representative, the Hujjat (proof), son of Al-Hasan, Your blessings be on him and his forefathers, in this hour and in every hour, a guardian, a protector, a leader, a helper, a guide, and an eye, until you make him live on Your earth, in obedience, and cause him to enjoy it for a long time. By Your mercy, O most Merciful of the merciful.

Peace be upon Hussain, and upon Ali, son of Hussain, and upon the children of Hussain, and upon the companions of Hussain.
