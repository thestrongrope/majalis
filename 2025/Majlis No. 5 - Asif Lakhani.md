### 1. The Quranic Foundation: Forgiveness, Ma'ruf, and Turning from Ignorance

Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has said in His Glorious Book, and His word is the truth, and He is the most truthful of speakers:
> خذ العفو وامر بالعرف واعراض عن الجاهلین
> Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; and turn away from the ignorant.
- [Reference needed]

We had designated this noble verse as the opening address for these five majalis.

In this noble verse, Allah the Exalted commands His Prophet, saying, "O Prophet, خذ العفو (Hold to forgiveness)." This means, make it your practice, your motto, your method, to ADOPT this method: continually forgive people. And deal with people GENTLY. Be very soft and mild with everyone.

وامر بالعرف (and command what is right). Always enjoin what is known to be good, or `Ma'ruf`. `Ma'ruf` means goodness.

واعرض عن الجاهلین (and turn away from the ignorant). And when an ignorant person addresses you, turn away from them. Do NOT argue with them, do not engage in unnecessary disputes with them, do not have UNNECESSARY discussions with them. That is, as I mentioned, do not give your viewpoint.

Continuing on this topic, consider that `Ma'ruf` – as I explained in the first gathering – means that which reason accepts and which brings pleasure to people when performed. It is something that people LIKE; that is called `Ma'ruf`. And because Allah’s commands, all His laws, all Divine laws, are in accordance with human nature, when people perform them, they feel good.

Now, there might be a question here, in a bracket, where people might say, "Well, in every religion, whatever a person does, they feel good about it. What's the reason for that?" If we have time today, God willing, we will try to cover why that is NOT `Ma'ruf`, and why THIS IS `Ma'ruf`. God willing, we will try to cover it if Allah grants us the ability.

### 2. The Essence of Ma'ruf: Wilayat of Ahlul Bayt and Righteous Character

**Ma'ruf: Definition and Primary Manifestations**

In any case, the FIRST and most important example, or manifestation, of `Ma'ruf` is the Imamate and Wilayat of the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them. Without a doubt. And within the Wilayat of the Ahlul Bayt, there is a very important matter, and that is `Azaadari` (mourning rituals).

So, before continuing, let me tell you that just as these children now recited the `Maqtal` of Sayyid al-Shuhada (Master of Martyrs), and these young boys and girls recite `Nawha` (elegies) – believe me, this is truly the BEST example of `Ma'ruf` after the majlis. This is the BEST example.

And believe me, I tell you with 100% confidence, this cannot happen unless there is a mother's prayer. Without a mother's prayer, this is simply NOT possible. And for a mother's prayer, her purity is the most important thing. These children who recite `Nawha`, who recite `Maqtal` now, or other children and youth who recite, this is a sign of purity of birth. Believe this. And it's possible that many people might not understand this now. Perhaps people will think, "He talks like this." But first of all, all of this is written in narrations. And secondly, it might not be understood now, but God willing, it will be understood very soon at the time of death and in Barzakh (the interim realm).

So remember, the MOST important example of `Ma'ruf` is the Wilayat of the Ahlul Bayt. The love of Ahlul Bayt. And when there is love for Ahlul Bayt, a person will AUTOMATICALLY, naturally, learn their teachings. When they learn their teachings, they will AUTOMATICALLY try to act upon them. And the more acquainted they become with them, the closer they get, the more their life will improve. Their actions should be like that, their character should be like that. Their character should be such that the Ahlul Bayt say, "This one is ours." This is a very important thing. Character, CHARACTER should be such that the Ahlul Bayt say, "This one is ours." It shouldn't be that the Ahlul Bayt distance themselves, saying "No." The Ahlul Bayt shouldn't distance themselves; rather, they should say, "This one is ours."

That is why we find a narration from an Imam who said:
> كونوا لنا زینا ولا تکونوا علینا شینا
> Be a source of adornment for us, and do not be a cause of disgrace for us.
- [Reference needed]

Look, be a source of ADORNMENT for us, so that people see you and say, "The lovers of Ahlul Bayt are like THIS." ولا تکونوا علینا شینا (and do not be a cause of disgrace for us). And do not be a cause of humiliation and disgrace for us. It shouldn't be that people see you and say, "All Shias are like this. They are not good; don't deal with them. Don't do transactions with them. They are dishonest; they are thieves." Or, "Their character is bad; they have bad intentions." This is a VERY important thing.

A man came to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, peace be upon him. And he said, "Because of you, we face great difficulties. We suffer a lot because of you." The Imam asked, "What difficulty do you face because of us?" He replied, "Whenever we meet someone, they ask, 'Are you a Shia?' In those days, Shias were called Ja'fari. So, 'Are you a Ja'fari? Are you a Shia?'" He said,
> جعفري خبيث
> Ja'faris are evil/wicked.
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, all Shias are wicked. This is a Hadith, and it's narrated in Usul al-Kafi. I'm reading a narration from Kafi for you.

Now, obviously, as soon as he said this, the Imam lowered his head. The Imam then asked him, "Are you defamed because of us? Is your reputation tarnished because of us?" Then the Imam defined a Shia in ONE sentence. "Do you know whom a Shia is called? Who is a Shia?" In one sentence. The Imam says in one sentence: "A Shia is one who, if someone goes into a city of one hundred thousand people and asks, 'Who is the BEST person in this entire city?' they would say, 'That person,' and point towards HIM, that Shia. If it is NOT like that, then he is NOT among our Shias." In every respect. His character should be like that.

That is why this method was taught, the verse that was selected for this discussion. And the teachings. What I told you until yesterday was, "Cultivate the habit of doing good to people. Keep doing good to everyone you meet." Only if you are CERTAIN that they will use it for something forbidden or for disobeying Allah, for disobeying Allah, then do NOT help them. If you KNOW, if you are certain, that they will disobey Allah.

Now sometimes, people, for example, you might have examples, surely you are more experienced than us. But what is in the Hadith, I am telling you: if you are certain that a person is going to commit a sin, then do NOT help them.

### 3. Lessons from History: Actions That Bear No Fruit

**Actions That Go to Waste (`Arba'a Tadhhabu`)**

Now, what is the Hadith? The Imam says:
> اربع تذهب ضیاعا
> Four things go to waste.
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, there are four things that have NO benefit. They are always wasted. Which four things?

1.  Sowing seeds in barren land. Barren land, right? Like a barren land, where you are CERTAIN that cultivation is impossible. If someone cultivates there, consider them insane, crazy. If someone cultivates. When you are CERTAIN. For example, if someone goes and sows seeds in a desert, what would you say to them? You would say, "What is this crazy person doing? How can there be cultivation in a desert?" There cannot be cultivation in a desert.
2.  And the second, the Imam illustrates:
    > والسراج فی القمر
    > and a lamp in the moonlight.
    - [Reference needed]
    And if, when the moon is shining brightly, someone brings a lamp, then they are WASTING that lamp.
3.  And the third thing:
    > والعقل علی الشبع
    > and eating when one is full.
    - [Reference needed]
    This is a very important thing. If your stomach is full, you should not eat. I'm not just speaking for youngsters; even from a health perspective, it's very correct to stop eating when there is still a little space left in your stomach. Don't fill your stomach completely; rather, leave a little space. It's good for health too. Otherwise, some people are such that they eat until here, and then if they have a stick in their hand, they might even put it inside and stir it and then eat.

And do you know whose characteristic this was in history? This characteristic was of Muawiyah. It is available in history. A very great Sunni scholar, a very great scholar of Ahl al-Sunnah. His book is even considered very authentic among the six Sahih books of Hadith for Ahl al-Sunnah. Bukhari, Muslim, Sunan Ibn Majah, Sunan Abu Dawud... No, that is: Bukhari is one, Muslim is two, Sunan Ibn Majah is three, Abu Dawud al-Sijistani is four, Nasa'i is five, and Tirmidhi is six. These are the six important books that are considered very significant among them. Among them is Nasa'i's. Nasa'i wrote a book. Besides his Sunan, his Sunan is considered important among them. He wrote a book. When he came to Syria, he saw that people were all speaking against Ali, peace be upon him. All the common people of Syria, because there was such intense propaganda that people didn't even consider Ali, peace be upon him, a Muslim. They even used to ask, "How was Ali martyred in the mosque? Was he praying? Did Ali pray?" So much propaganda, SO much propaganda.

So Nasa'i wrote a book. And he named this book:
> خصائص آل ابی طالب
> The Merits of the Family of Abu Talib.
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, the virtues of Abu Talib's children. When he wrote this book and it came into public view, he went to pray in the mosque. When he went to pray in the mosque, people there seized him. And they said to him, "You wrote this book about the merits of Ali, so why didn't you write such a book about OUR Amir (leader)? You should write about our Amir – meaning Muawiyah."

So he said, "What should I write about your Amir? I found no Hadith, only ONE Hadith from the Messenger of Allah concerning your Amir. And that was, the Messenger of Allah called him, but he didn't come. Then he called him again, meaning, he asked why he didn't come, and he said, 'He is eating.' Then after a while, he called him again, saying he called him again, but he didn't come. Why didn't he come? He said, 'He is eating again.' In this way, the Messenger of Allah called him three times, with small intervals, and each time he received the same answer: 'He is eating.' So the Prophet invoked this curse against him:
> لا اشبع الله بطن
> May Allah never fill his stomach.
- [Reference needed]

May he never be satiated, may his stomach never be full. What was the result? The result was that he kept eating his entire life. And he ate so much that when his clothes were found in his grave, the entire garment was covered in oil. He ate so much that he would wipe his mouth with his hands and wouldn't even go to wash them. So you see, people beat Nasa'i so much, they beat him so much when he narrated that Hadith, that he died. He died.

Now, some people ask us, "Well, if he died in the path of the Ahlul Bayt, won't he go to Paradise?" So we say, "Look, we are nobody to decide about Paradise and Hell. Now, it's between Ali and him." But we know one thing: if one wants to go to Paradise, the love for the Ahlul Bayt MUST be pure. PURE love for the Ahlul Bayt. If any impurity of anyone else enters it, then a person cannot go to Paradise.

So, these are three things. What was the first thing? Sowing seeds in barren land. The second, lighting a lamp in front of the moon. The third, eating when your stomach is full. These are also wasted.

4.  And the fourth thing:
    > اَلْمَعْرُوفُ اِلىٰ مَنْ لَّیْسَ بِاَهْلِہٖ
    > Doing good to one who is not deserving of it.
    - [Reference needed]

Doing good to someone who doesn't deserve it. This is something that will be WASTED.

But regarding other people. Other people, look, we are repeatedly emphasizing this. Because a Shia, you see, is an AMBASSADOR of the Ahlul Bayt. Every Shia, for their group, whether small or large, young or old, male or female, anyone. Whether they are a businessman or a professional. In every respect, every person, what are they? They are an AMBASSADOR. They are an emissary. They are representing the Ahlul Bayt. Therefore, what should their character be like? The Ahlul Bayt have taught that. It should be such that they continue to spread `Ma'ruf`, goodness.

Now, listen to this Hadith. The Hadith is astonishing. The Imam says:
> لَا تُحَقِّرَنَّ شَیْئاً مِنَ الْمَعْرُوفِ
> Never belittle any act of goodness, no matter how small.
- [Reference needed]

Never consider a small act of goodness as insignificant.
> وَلَوْ اَنْ تَلْقٰۤی اَخَاکَ وَوَجْہُکَ مَبْسُوْطٌ اِلَیْہِ
> Even if it is just meeting your brother with a cheerful face.
- [Reference needed]

That when you meet your brother, you meet them with a smile. This is also a good deed. When you meet your brother.

However, there is an exception to this: if it is a day of sorrow for the Ahlul Bayt, then one should not smile on that day.

Now, a clip went viral about this, so let me answer that too, because many people are asking separately, and I've gotten tired of answering individually. So I thought I'd answer it all at once in one gathering.

You see, you have heard the Hadith, I have heard it, all the elders know it. What is written in the Hadith? That on the day of Ashura, when you meet each other, say:
> اَعْظَمَ اللّٰهُ اُجُوْرَنَا وَاُجُوْرَکُمْ فِیْ مُصَابِنَا بِالْحُسَیْنِ عَلَیْهِ السَّلَامُ وَجَعَلَنَا اِیَّاکُمْ
> May Allah multiply our rewards and your rewards for our affliction by Husain, peace be upon him, and may He make us and you...
- [Reference needed]

The whole phrase, isn't it? Everyone knows this is how you meet. Now, obviously, the Ahlul Bayt did NOT command us to greet each other in this way. So now, greeting is not appropriate. Greeting is not appropriate. And there is no jurisprudential fatwa (religious decree) that greeting is forbidden or reprehensible. None of that.

This is a proof of a person's faith. For example, if someone's father passed away, what do you go and ask them? "Is everything else okay?" Would you ask them? "Assalamu Alaikum! Brother, is everything okay?" They would say, "What a crazy person! Our father passed away, our brother passed away, and he's asking 'Assalamu Alaikum' and 'is everything else okay?'" So if someone asks, "Is it forbidden?" Look, not everything is decided by the criteria of lawful and unlawful. Some things are decided based on emotions and beliefs. That is why the Ahlul Bayt taught this.

And that is why I'll give you an example of a religious scholar to complete the point. So, for example, the objection was that he was saying, "In the Ziyarat (pilgrimage salutation), we recite:
> اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَیْکَ یَا اَبَا عَبْدِاللہِ
> Peace be upon you, O Abul Abdullah.
- [Reference needed]

Look, the "Salam" we recite in Ziyarat has a different meaning. The "Salam" we say to each other has a different meaning. When we greet each other, it's called `Tahiyyat`. The "Salam" we say to each other is called `Tahiyyat`. `Tahiyyat` means greetings. We greet each other, and this is also taught in the Quran. It has come in the Quran; it's called `Tahiyyat`, remember: greetings, greeting each other, like "How are you?" "Assalamu Alaikum." Like "Good morning," "Good evening." Right? For example, on the day of Ashura, would you say "Good evening," "Good morning" to each other? Would you say, "Have a nice day" on Ashura? Huh? No, you wouldn't.

Now, the `Assalamu Alaikum` that comes in Ziyarat does NOT come in the meaning of greetings. Rather, that `Salam` is from the Ahlul Bayt, meaning it comes in the meaning of Salawat (blessings) upon them. It comes in the meaning of raising their ranks. It does NOT come in the meaning of greetings. Therefore, everything is... So now I'll give an example of a religious scholar.

You know, there was a very great religious scholar. He spent his last few years here in Mumbai. Allamah Sayyid Zeeshan Haider Jawadi, may Allah elevate his status. When he used to live here, during the month of Ramadan, he came late one night. It was Ramadan. And some boys, you know, during Ramadan, it is highly emphasized and recommended to play carrom.

Now, look, in Muslim areas, this is all that goes on; the whole night passes like this. You probably know. So he came, and he saw people playing carrom. So he admonished them, saying, "What are you people doing? These are nights of worship. You should be reciting supplications, performing worship. You are doing all that; what are you doing all this for?" But he did his job; he enjoined the good (`Amr bil Ma'ruf`). One of those individuals, I think I shouldn't mention the name, but he was there. He turned back and retorted, "Maulana, is playing carrom forbidden?" So he replied,
> اَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْجَاهِلِينَ
> Turn away from the ignorant.
- [Reference needed]

He did not answer; he just walked away. He lived there; he left.

Then, the next day, by chance, he had a majlis there, where he lived, and a large crowd used to gather for that majlis. So, he raised this point in the majlis, and remember this point; it was a very good point. He said, "Last night, I came, and this incident happened: children were playing carrom here. Not children, but grown men. They were playing carrom. I admonished them, and I was given this reply: 'Is it forbidden?'"

So, look, his answer was very good. We were in that majlis. He said, "Look, not everything is weighed on the scale of lawful and unlawful. Indeed, indeed. If your father passed away and I came there with a bat and ball, and I said, 'Let's play some bat and ball and also participate in the burial.' Any person seeing this would say, 'Maulana, what are you doing? Their father passed away, and you have brought a bat and ball.' So, I would turn and ask, 'Is it forbidden?' 'Is playing bat and ball forbidden?' He would say, 'Brother, this is not about lawful and unlawful. Oh, someone's father has passed away; you should console them. Is this any way?'"

So, understand that on the day of Ashura and on days of sorrow for the Ahlul Bayt, we should ESPECIALLY not celebrate. Otherwise, on any other day, when you meet a believer, meet them with a smile. And this is the BEST `Ma'ruf`.

Maintain good character. For example, if we are drinking water, there is no difficulty in simply offering it to the person in front of you. Offer it to the person in front. If there are four people, offer it to everyone first. This is character. Or as I told you, it is mentioned in the Hadith that if someone comes, make space for them. Even if there is a lot of space, move a little, just out of respect. This is character. It's in the Hadith. The whole place might be empty. But because a believer has entered, out of respect, move a little for them.

Similarly, even if we tell you to teach others good manners. To non-Muslims too. Tell them, if a non-Muslim comes, make a little space for them. So, they will ask, they will DEFINITELY ask, "Why do you do that?" Say, "These are our religious teachings. Our Imams taught us this." So, they will automatically be inclined. But maintain this consistently. This is a very important thing.

So, you see, this is the way to attract people to your religion. This is called `Ma'ruf`. And look how amazing the Hadith is: the Imam says,
> عَجِبْتُ مِنْ مَنْ یَّشْتَرِی الْمَمَالِکَ بِمَالِہٖ کَیْفَ لَا یَشْتَرِی الْاَحْرَارَ بِمَعْرُوْفِہٖ فَیَمْلِکُھُمْ
> I am astonished at one who buys slaves with his wealth, why does he not buy free people with his good deeds, so he may own them?
- [Reference needed]

I am astonished at that person. Astonished. Who buys slaves with money. In those times, people used to buy slaves with money. In today's time, they don't buy slaves with money; they have other ways of enslaving. Why doesn't he make free people his slaves through his character? Subhanallah! Why is he buying a slave? Let him win people's hearts through his character! Subhanallah! This is the way.

Now, look at politicians; you know them, right? They spend millions and billions of rupees. For what? To win votes. To gain power. But if you ask, "How many people's hearts do they truly rule?" It would be very few. Of course, there is one principle:
> اَلنَّاسُ عَلٰی دِیْنِ مُلُوْکِهِمْ
> People follow the religion of their rulers.
- [Reference needed]

Generally, the common people follow the religion of their rulers. They follow what the ruler does. This is a general principle. But generally, if you look, they do NOT rule over hearts.

But a teacher will. He rules over the hearts of his students. A truly real Imam rules over his followers. So, keep doing good as much as you can. Keep doing good as much as you can.

### 4. The Etiquette of Charity: Avoiding Reminder and Harm

**Avoiding Reminding of Favors**

But since today is the last majlis, we are quickly concluding the discussion very fast so that it can be completed. But the important thing here is that the one who does the good deed should FORGET it. The one who does it. The one upon whom the good deed is done should REMEMBER it. That is, the one who does the kindness, the benefactor, should forget it. And the one upon whom the kindness is done, who is called `muhsin` in Arabic, should remember it, no matter how small the kindness was. So that they never forget the kindness. So that they never forget that someone did a small act of kindness for them. They should never forget.

That is why Commander of the Faithful says? Listen to the sentence. Listen to the sentence. He says, "If someone taught me ONE letter." He didn't say `word`; there's a difference between `word` and `letter`. `Word` means a word, and `harf` (letter) means an alphabet. So a word is formed from alphabets. Commander of the Faithful says, "If someone taught me ONE letter, his right is upon my neck." Look at the teachings of Ahlul Bayt! What they are. "His right is upon my neck." So, if someone does even a small kindness, one should remember it: "He did me a kindness."

But the one who does the kindness should immediately forget it after doing it. Why should they forget it? What is its wisdom? What is its wisdom? So that they never remind the other person, "I did this kindness for them." Because reminding of kindness is a sign of being `kam-zarf`. `Kam-zarf`, you understand, right? `Kam-zarf` is someone who... what would be the translation of `kam-zarf` in Urdu? It's a very powerful word, `kam-zarf`. Meaning, `kam-zarf` is someone whose heart is very small. Those with small hearts are called `kam-zarf` in Urdu.

That is why Bahadur Shah Zafar's couplet was, wasn't it? "The city became empty of nobles; those who were `kam-zarf` became exalted." What a saying. "The city became empty of nobles," meaning honorable people. "Now no honorable person is left in the city. The city became empty of nobles; those who were `kam-zarf` became exalted." Then the third and fourth lines are not suitable to be recited here, so I'm not reciting them.

Now listen to the verses of the Quran quickly; I will read them to you. There are three verses from Surah Al-Baqarah, I'll read them very fast. The Quran says:
> اَلَّذِیْنَ یُنْفِقُوْنَ اَمْوَالَهُمْ فِیْ سَبِیْلِ اللّٰهِ ثُمَّ لَا یُتْبِعُوْنَ مَاۤ اَنْفَقُوْا مَنًّا وَّ لَاۤ اَذًی
> Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah and then do not follow up what they have spent with reminders of their generosity or injury.
- [Reference needed]

Those people – Allah is talking about believers. Who is a believer? One who spends their money in the way of Allah. Then, what they spend, they never follow up with `mann` (reminding of kindness) or `adha` (harm). `Mann` in Arabic means reminding of kindness. They never remind of kindness. And they never cause distress or trouble to the one upon whom they have bestowed kindness. This is a verse of the Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah. We are repeatedly emphasizing the Quran, telling the youth and children to read the Quran.
> لَهُمْ اَجْرُهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ وَّ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَ لَا ہُمْ یَحْزَنُوْنَ
> They will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.
- [Reference needed]

These are the individuals whose reward is with their Lord. Meaning, no one can calculate their reward except Allah. Their reward is that immense. Only Allah can give such a reward. Neither will there be any fear upon them, nor will they ever grieve. Such are the believers; they never have fear. And they never grieve for the sake of this world, remember. They never grieve for the sake of this world. No fear means, of course, fear of Allah. And they never grieve for the sake of this world. If they grieve, it's for the sake of Ahlul Bayt. Never for the world.

After that, the next verse says:
> قَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوْفٌ وَّ مَغْفِرَةٌ خَیْرٌ مِّنْ صَدَقَةٍ یَّتْبَعُهَاۤ اَذٰی وَ اللّٰهُ غَنِیٌّ حَلِیْمٌ
> Kind speech and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing.
- [Reference needed]

Look, the same thing we were talking about, the Quran is saying it. قَوْلٌ مَّعْرُوْفٌ (Kind speech). You speak good words وَّ مَغْفِرَةٌ (and forgiveness). And forgive everyone! Forgive. خَیْرٌ مِّنْ صَدَقَةٍ (is better than charity). This is better than that charity, یَّتْبَعُهَاۤ اَذٰی (followed by injury). where people are hurt by reminding them of favors. وَ اللّٰهُ غَنِیٌّ حَلِیْمٌ (And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing). وَ اللّٰهُ غَنِیٌّ حَلِیْمٌ (And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing). Allah is Self-Sufficient, meaning He is free of need. Allah does NOT need your charity. حَلِیْمٌ (Most Forbearing). Allah is only tolerating you. If Allah were not Forbearing, His punishment would descend upon you right now. `Haleem` means forbearing, enduring, tolerant. Allah is tolerating. What is one of Allah's names? Which we recite in Du'a Jawshan Kabeer, in the last 101st section, when it starts, we recite Du'a Jawshan Kabeer in the month of Ramadan, but it should be recited all year round. Yes, it's not just for Ramadan; in Ramadan, its reward is just greater. Otherwise, the entire Jawshan Kabeer, you know, what is it? It is the Greatest Names of Allah. It is the Greatest Name. If you truly want to do something great, recite Du'a Jawshan Kabeer and see what happens. People say it's great, it's great, right? Break it into three parts. Recite it in three parts, three times a day or three times in three days, Du'a Jawshan Kabeer.

Anyway, what is its last part? What do you say? "یا حلیم لا یاجل" (O Forbearing One, Who does not hasten). It is a name of Allah. O that Forbearing One, O that Patient One, O that Forbearing One Who does NOT hasten in giving punishment. Subhanallah, Subhanallah, Subhanallah.

Allah does not hasten. And what kind of hastiness does He not show? Just think. Pharaoh ruled for many years, for many years. And every day he kept saying, the whole day he kept saying,
> "انا ربکم الاعلی"
> I am your Lord, the Most High.
- [Reference needed]

"Why do you believe in such a God whom you cannot see? You can see me, look!"

And who corrected his monotheism (`Tawheed`)? Satan corrected it. Who corrected Pharaoh's monotheism? Satan corrected it. He was bathing in the public bath. Satan came into the public bath. And he came and gave him a HARD slap. He gave a strong slap on his face. Now, children probably don't understand "slap"; they understand, right? "Thappad" (slap) in common language. You understood? He hit him hard. As soon as Pharaoh got hit, he said, "Who are you?" And, "How did you come in without my permission?" Immediately, Satan said, "O FOOL! You call yourself God? Huh? First of all, look at your ignorance; you don't even know who I am." Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. That God is the one who knows everything. Subhanallah. Iblis said, "My God is the one who knows everything, and you don't recognize me." He asked, "Who are you?" And you are so helpless that I came in, and you couldn't stop me. I slapped you, and you couldn't stop me. You couldn't do anything to me. My Lord, Iblis said, "My Lord is the one who has power over everything. He destroys whoever He wills."

Iblis corrected Pharaoh's monotheism. Pharaoh understood. He used to sit at night, tied himself with a rope, and cry, "O Lord, You know that what I am inviting people to is wrong. But I am inviting everyone openly; please preserve my honor."

Similarly, in the Quran, when the drowning of Pharaoh is mentioned, this is a verse of the Quran. Pharaoh said,
> "امننت برب موسی و هارون"
> I believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron.
- [Reference needed]

Allah, meaning, Allah replied, "You have believed too late. Too late." Now, when death appeared before him, that faith was of no benefit. Well, that's a separate discussion. But before drowning, he said to Prophet Moses, "Moses, save me, save me!" But Moses just turned away, he left. When he came to Mount Tur, Allah said, "Moses, Pharaoh was saying to you, 'Save me.' If he had said to ME, 'Save me,' I would have saved him." Subhanallah, Subhanallah.

So generous is the Lord. Without a doubt. So merciful. Now, look at what Allah says in this verse, "والله غني حلیم" (And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing). Allah has no need for you. Allah has no need for your spending. If you do not spend in the way of Allah, if you do not spend on mourning gatherings, if you do not spend on charity, if you do not spend for the Imam, it's alright; Allah does not need you. He is free of need, and Allah is very Forbearing. Do NOT remind of your favors.

After that, look at what the next verse says, 264 of Surah Baqarah, 264:
> "یا ایها الذین آمنوا لا تبطلوا صدقاتکم بالمن والاذی کالذی ینفق ماله ریاء الناس ولا یومن بالله والیوم الآخر"
> O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities with reminders of your generosity or injury, like the one who spends his wealth to be seen by people and does not believe in Allah or the Last Day.
- [Reference needed]

Look, do not ruin your charities, your `sadaqat`, by reminding of your favors and by causing distress. If you remind of your favors and cause distress, because it's a matter of the tongue, isn't it? The wound of the tongue is very deep. The wound of the tongue is very deep. "کالذی" (Like the one who...). Then look, Allah gives an example. Like the one who, "ینفق ماله ریاء الناس" (spends his wealth to be seen by people). Like that person who spends his wealth only for show, for ostentation. That's what we talked about, taking photos. So everyone knows, "I told one person, and I told 10 people that I spent so much." "Oh, yes, I spent so much." This is ostentation, showing off.

It is mentioned in a narration, this Hadith is that if someone does a good deed, listens very carefully, then his reward is complete. The reward is complete, meaning the recompense, yes. If one does a good deed, his reward is complete. If he tells one person that I did this good deed, then his reward becomes half. It becomes half. And if he tells two people that I did this good deed, I did this favor, then it's no longer half; that good deed is NOT recorded anymore. That good deed is ERASED, and a sin is recorded instead. He did a good deed, just like many times, if God forbid, God forbid, we perform the night prayer (`Namaz-e Shab`), then we are restless to tell someone that we performed the night prayer. So, what's the way? We can't say it directly, right? So, we say, "Oh, Yaseen brother, it's good that I met you today. I remembered you in my `Namaz-e Shab`." Yes. Meaning, this was our way of saying that we perform `Namaz-e Shab`. Even if we didn't actually remember them. But they found out that you perform `Namaz-e Shab`.

So, look at what the Quran says: "ولا یومن بالله والیوم الآخر" (and does not believe in Allah or the Last Day). And such a person believes neither in Allah nor in the Day of Judgment. The one who reminds of his favors. Do good, do kindness, but NEVER remind anyone. Do it and forget it.

And then the Quran gives an example. What is its example?
> "فمثله کمثل صفوان علیه تراب فاصابه وابل فترکه صلدا لا یقدرون علی شیء مما کسبوا"
> So his example is like that of a smooth rock on which is soil. Then a heavy rain falls upon it and leaves it bare. They are unable to do anything with what they have earned.
- [Reference needed]

This is like a large boulder with soil on it. Heavy rain falls, and all the soil washes away. In the same way, all his deeds will wash away. Nothing will remain. Whatever he did, his reward will be ZERO. ZERO. We have seen only one other verse like this in the Quran, where Allah says that nothing will be gained. And what is that other verse? That other verse is similar:
> "وقدمنا الی ما عملوا من عمل فجعلناه هباء منثورا"
> And We shall turn to whatever deeds they did, and We shall make them as scattered dust.
- [Reference needed]

Then all their good deeds, many good deeds, many, will be presented before them. And when they see them, they will be happy seeing their good deeds. At that moment, what will happen is that all their good deeds will be scattered away. All gone, ZERO. And they will see it as ZERO. Why is it zero? What is the reason?

In the exegesis (`Tafsir`) of this verse, the Imam says that it means that a person does many good deeds, many. But what happens? As soon as a sin appears before him, he immediately commits that sin, and all his good deeds are erased. So, in the light of this verse and this Hadith, one should try to distance oneself from sins as much as possible. Because the two cannot coexist.

### 5. Exemplars of True Devotion: Historical Accounts of Loyalty

**Loyalty and Submission in Practice**

Anyway, what I was telling you. Let's come back to our topic: that in `Ma'ruf`, doing charity, doing this and that, all these are good things, very good things, and have great reward. But the GREATEST charity, the GREATEST thing, what is it? The Wilayat of Ahlul Bayt. Remember this point. Meaning, love the Ahlul Bayt boundlessly. Do it yourself and teach your children too. Remember this, do NOT forget.

Look, in history, there is a mention of a companion named Amr. Amr ibn Hamiq al-Khuzai. He was a very powerful companion. At a very young age, a very young age, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, came to his village. He was very young, extremely young. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, felt thirsty, so he simply said that he was looking for someone to give him water. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, did not even say it verbally. He just indicated that he was looking for water. Amr, Amr understood the Messenger of Allah's actions and knew that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, needed water. And he ran and brought water and gave it to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, liked Amr's action so much because he got up and went so quickly, so fast. So the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, prayed, "O Amr, may Allah keep you young until your last breath." Subhanallah, Subhanallah, Subhanallah. "As long as you live, may this youth remain in you." Subhanallah. What youth remained in Amr, it was amazing. He was alive during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family.

After that, you know, we have studied history; I briefly mentioned it to you. Until yesterday, I presented it fully. Then, when other people came into power, Amr did what Abu Lu'lu' did to the second one; Amr did it to the third one. You understand, right, brother? Yes. So that was Amr's work. Do you know this? That was Amr's work. That's why the opponents of Commander of the Faithful used to accuse him that his followers did it. That's why they kept raising his shirt. The bloody shirt, you know the tunic, right? The blood-stained tunic. On which all the battles were fought. And by showing this blood-stained tunic, all the people were killed.

Anyway, then Commander of the Faithful's apparent caliphate came. In 35 AH, Amir al-Mu'minin became the apparent Caliph. From 35 AH, Dhul Hijjah - yes, Dhul Hijjah. And in some places, it's written Rajab, and in some places, Dhul Hijjah. That is, 22nd of Rajab is written. Right? There are different dates. Anyway, Amir al-Mu'minin became the apparent Caliph. Now, Amir al-Mu'minin was appointing governors, giving power to some, this power, that power, giving it to everyone. So everyone was sitting in anticipation.

Look, I'll tell you another incident; it suddenly came to mind.

Ibn Abbas, you know Ibn Abbas, right? He was the cousin of Imam Ali, peace be upon him. Imam Ali, peace be upon him, taught him like his younger brother. He taught him a lot. He didn't teach others as much as he taught Ibn Abbas. But teaching alone doesn't do anything. The capacity of the learner, how much they can digest, that's also important. I'll tell you that too. You understand, right? There are many teachers, many students. There are, aren't there? "Life passed like this, wandering in the wilderness, the companion is the back of Shabbir in praise, not in Muharram." Right?

So, that's why we are saying that teaching alone doesn't do anything. It's the capacity of the learner that is seen. Commander of the Faithful taught Ibn Abbas a lot. Alright. Now, as soon as the caliphate passed away from Commander of the Faithful, people thought, "Well, whoever is close to Ali, give them so much money that they come to our side." They started distributing money. Whoever was close to Ali, give them money, fill their mouths. Ibn Abbas was one of them. They gave him money. So, at first, he said, "No, no, I am with Ali." At first, somewhat formally, "Oh, he is my teacher, my teacher." Many people speak like that, don't they? After that, what happened was, as soon as the other person's era came, he said, "Ibn Abbas, come and become my secretary." So Ibn Abbas went and became his secretary. Secretary, you know what a secretary is, right? Not a prime minister. He made him a prime minister, directly straight, "Come, you become one."

When the news reached Imam Ali, peace be upon him, he was completely SHOCKED. Shocked that this? Meaning, he is also his cousin, also his student. So Imam Ali, peace be upon him, went. Or he met Ibn Abbas. And he said, "Ibn Abbas, I did NOT expect this from you." Is it clear, right? Imam Ali, peace be upon him, is saying it. "I did NOT expect this from you that you would go and join them." Now, since he had power, it went to his head. So he said, "Ali, you always do this. Look, the whole Ummah is united. Look at the unity in the Ummah, have you seen it? And you are the only one who is different from everyone else." And he used a word, "You are `fariqul ummah`." `Fariqul ummah` means one who creates division in the Ummah. "You are creating disunity in the Ummah, Ali." Can you imagine what Imam Ali, peace be upon him, must have felt? His student, his cousin, was saying this to Imam Ali, peace be upon him. But anyway, Imam Ali, peace be upon him, said nothing, he remained silent. What answer could he give?
> اعرض عن الجاهلين
> Turn away from the ignorant.
- [Reference needed]

He turned away. "Alright, he left."

But we are saying this because even today you might be hearing this slogan of unity, right? You understood, right? The slogan of unity was there even at that time. It's not a new slogan. It's very old. So, those who speak in this manner, for example, all the companions of Imam Ali, peace be upon him, there's a lot of history; we will tell you, God willing, if Allah grants us life and ability.

Now, when Commander of the Faithful's apparent caliphate came, Commander of the Faithful was taking allegiance in a place called Dhi Qar. That place was called Dhi Qar. Commander of the Faithful was sitting there for allegiance, and he said, "Exactly 1000 people will come here to pledge allegiance to me." 1000 people. I'm not going to tell the whole story; I'll tell it very short and move towards Amr. 1000 people will come.

So, doubt arose in Ibn Abbas's heart. Look. Now, it's the apparent caliphate, so Ibn Abbas came to this side. You've heard, haven't you? "Wherever the Kaaba was, there was the Zoroastrian." So, he came with Imam Ali, peace be upon him. Well, what now? What now? Whose slave are you? A slave of power. In whose hand is power? "We are with whoever is victorious." So Ibn Abbas came and sat with Imam Ali, peace be upon him. Imam Ali, peace be upon him, said, "Exactly 1000 people will come here to pledge allegiance to me." Ibn Abbas sat down and started counting. Look, he didn't trust. Doubt arose in his heart. Okay, he started counting. 1, 2, 3... Silently, yes. It's properly written in books that he was counting in his heart. 999 people came.

Hmm. Ibn Abbas said, "What was the need to say that 1000 would come? Look, one less came, didn't he? One less came, didn't he?" He was still thinking that when an old man came, a bit elderly, and in his hand was a sword, and in his hand was armor, a shield, armor. And he had a waterskin. He was the 1000th one. Commander of the Faithful asked, "What is your name?" He said, "Uways." Uways al-Qarani. Commander of the Faithful embraced him. "My beloved Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, had told me, 'O Ali, Uways will come and pledge allegiance on your hands.'" Subhanallah, what a saying! When people are in doubt. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. This Uways was not with Imam Ali, peace be upon him. He lived very far away. He had not even seen the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. When he came to see the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, had already passed away. But the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, had given a prophecy about him beforehand. He had foretold about him beforehand. This Uways. And this Uways was then martyred with Imam Ali, peace be upon him. Uways al-Qarani, this rank. And there, look, Ibn Abbas is there. So, look, there is a level. What is the level of submission? That's why one should submit completely. If there is even a slight doubt, then faith is gone.

Car number 1484, whose car is it, brother? 1484. Please move that car; it's blocking. Brothers, please do not do this. We are just discussing this. I didn't give an example, I thought it wouldn't happen here. But in some places, it does happen; there we read this a lot. That some people think, "Oh, in the name of Ahlul Bayt, we'll block another car; it's fine." No, no. This is NOT permissible, I'm saying, in any way. No one should be inconvenienced because of us. Subhanallah. No one at all. And especially, read the Hadiths; the topic is very vast. Take great care of neighbors. Even if they are very sinful or not of your religion, not of your sect. We were in Tehran attending a majlis during the days of mourning in Tehran. A very great scholar, he passed away recently, a very great scholar. Very great. He was reciting the majlis. It was packed. So, an announcement was made that someone's car was blocking the neighbor's gate. So, it turned out to be the car of the Maulana who was sitting right next to him. So the Maulana just read out the number, "Whose car is this?" So he said, "It's mine." So the Maulana flared up at him. "Why did you park the car there?" He said, "He doesn't come to the majlis." Then for at least 15 minutes, the Maulana delivered the entire majlis on that topic.

We were trying to mention a companion every day who was completely immersed in the love of the Ahlul Bayt. Among them was Amr ibn Hamiq al-Khuzai. He was immersed in the love of Imam Ali, peace be upon him. Now, Imam Ali, peace be upon him, is here, and it's the apparent caliphate; he is distributing things. Appointing governors, appointing this, appointing that. Distributing all powers. Now powers are being distributed, right? Obviously, every person is involved in aspiration, and that's why the Battle of Jamal happened, wasn't it? Talha and Zubayr went to that side for that reason. Because Zubayr came and said, "Brother, I want power." Commander of the Faithful said, "Alright, take it." Then he said, "I was expecting this!" As soon as he said he was expecting it, he took it back. Is it clear, right? That the Maulana said, if he was expecting it, he wouldn't give it. That's why they became enemies. Anyway, that's a separate matter.

Amr ibn Hamiq al-Khuzai comes to Commander of the Faithful. Listen. And he comes and says, "O Ali, by God, I swear by God, I do not love you because you are the Caliph at this time. I do not love you because you are distributing money from the public treasury. I do not love you because you are giving people positions. Rather, I love you for three reasons:
*   First, you are the brother of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family;
*   Second, you are the husband of Fatima Zahra, peace be upon her; Subhanallah.
*   Third, you are the father of Hasanayn, peace be upon them. Subhanallah. Subhanallah.

O Ali, now listen to this sentence. O Ali, if you tell me to break mountains my entire life and move them from here to there. Or to empty the ocean cup by cup and die doing this work my entire life. If I die obeying you, obeying you, it will still feel as if I have not fulfilled the right of loyalty." Subhanallah. Subhanallah. "I have done nothing."

Commander of the Faithful said, "Amr, if I only had 100 individuals like you, 100 people, then I would take those people who are righteous to rule." But Commander of the Faithful had no one. And then, when Commander of the Faithful was martyred, and the pauper of Syria became the ruler of all Muslims, the governor, then the ruler of all Muslims, the first thing he did was, the very first thing, he issued a warrant for Amr. An arrest warrant was issued. Amr ibn Hamiq al-Khuzai must be arrested immediately. Amr fled. Now he went underground. Now, you see, he was `kam-zarf` (mean-spirited), so what did he do? He arrested Amr's wife. He said, "Now announce that Amr's wife is in our custody. Now surrender yourself to us, otherwise you know what the consequence will be." Now you understand; we are not going into details. If someone's honor falls into someone else's hands, you understand what happens.

Now, Amr was a man of honor. Amr immediately surrendered himself to the local police there. As soon as he surrendered, a letter went from the governor saying, "We have captured Amr in Mosul. Mosul is a city in Iraq, isn't it? In Iraq. We have captured Amr." So, an immediate reply came from Syria, "Immediately behead Amr. Cut his throat and put his head on a spear and parade it throughout the market."

So, after narrating this Hadith, the Imam says that Amr's head was the first head in Islam that was paraded on a spear. It was the first head in Islam. Before this, Muslims had NEVER practiced cutting the throats of enemies and putting them on spears. This was the first practice. And then, after that, it became commonplace because such people started ruling. So it became common among Muslims, and even today, you see that all this is common. Today, you see videos, don't you? Videos came from Syria recently, did you see them? Where Shias' throats were cut, and they were playing football with their heads. They were playing football with the heads. And they were also chanting "Allahu Akbar." These are Muslims.

Allama Iqbal says, "These are Muslims, whom even Jews would be ashamed to see." Meaning, Allama Iqbal says, "Consciousness has been lost, so the Muslims are annihilated from the world. We ask, were Muslims ever existing? In demeanor, you are Christians, and in culture, Hindus. These are Muslims, whom even Jews would be ashamed to see." Jews. "You may be a Sayyid, a Mirza, an Agha, you are everything, tell me, are you also a Muslim?" Wow, wow, wow, wow. This is the state of Muslims, and the same tradition has been continuing. The same thing. Why? Because they did the same in Karbala. This chain continued until 61 AH came. Karbala took place. The day of Ashura came. Everyone was martyred; no one was left.

### 6. The Ultimate Sacrifice: Imam Hussain's Final Moments

**Concluding Narration: Karbala (Maqtal)**

Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, had already raised the cry for help; now no one was left. Now Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, was alone. He came to the tent door once and called out:
> یا زینب، یا ام کلثوم، یا رقیہ، یا فضہ، علیکن من السلام
> O Zaynab, O Umm Kulthum, O Ruqayyah, O Fidhdhah, upon you be my final peace.
- [Reference needed]

As soon as Zaynab, peace be upon her, heard, "My final salutation be accepted," she was distressed. "Brother, what does this final salutation mean?" She asked,
> استسلمت للموت؟
> Have you surrendered to death?
- [Reference needed]

Commander of the Faithful replied,
> کیف لا یستسلم للموت من لا معین لہ ولا ناصر
> How can one not surrender to death who has no helper and no supporter?
- [Reference needed]

Zaynab, peace be upon her, said, "Brother, do not say that; Zaynab is still alive." She said, "If Zaynab is here, then Zaynab, take me to Sayyid Sajjad." Zaynab, peace be upon her, held Imam Hussain's arm, peace be upon him, and came to Sayyid Sajjad. "Son, Sayyid Sajjad, peace be upon him, wake up, son, come to your senses, look, father has come." It is written in the `Maqtal` that Sayyid Sajjad, peace be upon him, could not recognize the Imam. "Where is father? Where is father?" Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, embraced him, "Son, how will you recognize me? My whole body is drenched in blood. Full of wounds. Imam Hussain's body had bled all day from carrying bodies." Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, embraced him. Sayyid Sajjad, peace be upon him, asked, "Oh father, what has happened to you? Mother, bring a sword, I will help my father." Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, said, "No, son, this is not the place for your jihad. Your jihad will be in the markets of Kufa and Syria. Son, be patient. And when you go to Medina, convey my greetings to my Shias and tell them:
> ما ان شربتم ماء عذب فاذکرونی
> Whenever you drink cool water, remember my thirst.
- [Reference needed]

Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, bid farewell to Sayyid Sajjad, peace be upon him. He came. After coming, he looked towards the battlefield once. On the 28th of Rajab, when Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, left Medina, he said,
> اھْبِئَا دَاَبْباَسْ، قَدِّمْ جَوَاْدِی
> O Abbas, prepare my horse, bring forth my steed.
- [Reference needed]

Abbas, peace be upon him, had brought the horse. The youth of Bani Hashim were around Imam Hussain, peace be upon him. Now, all their bodies lay fallen. Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, called out:
> یَا اَبْطَالَ الصَّفَاَ، وَ یَا فُرْسَانَ الْهِیْجَاَ ما لَکُمْ اُنا جیْکُمْ فَلاَ تُجیْبُوْنیْ اَیُّکُمْ یُقَدِِّمُ جَوَادِی
> O heroes of purity, and O horsemen of battle! What is wrong with you? I call upon you, but you do not answer me. Which of you will bring my horse?
- [Reference needed]

"O my lions! O my horsemen! O my brave ones! What has happened to you? I call upon you, but you do not answer me. Who will help me mount?" It is not surprising that the bodies began to tremble, "Master, death has compelled us." Zaynab, peace be upon her, came out. Zaynab, peace be upon her, came and helped Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, mount. Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, mounted. Zaynab, peace be upon her, bid her final farewell. Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, departed.

Now, it is written in the `Maqtal` that Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, launched three attacks. The first attack was towards Nainawa; it was such a powerful attack that the armies collided with the walls of Nainawa. Then Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, turned back, and the second attack was towards the Euphrates. Cutting through the armies, he reached the bank of the Euphrates, "Abbas! My brother, rise, look at me." Then Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, returned. After returning, he launched the third attack. He paused for a moment to catch his breath, when suddenly a voice of truth came, a call from Allah:
> یا ایُّھَا النَّفْسُ الْمُطْمَئِنَّۃْ ارْجِعِ اِلٰی رَبِّکَ رَاضِیَۃَ مَّرْضِیَّۃْ
> O tranquil soul! Return to your Lord, well-pleased [with Him] and well-pleasing [to Him].
- [Reference needed]

As soon as he heard this voice, Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, sheathed his sword. Now, listen to the rest of the `Maqtal` from the words of Imam Ali Zayn al-Abidin, peace be upon him. Imam Ali Zayn al-Abidin, peace be upon him, says that as soon as my father sheathed his sword, someone struck him with a sword, someone thrust a spear, arrows rained down, and if someone found nothing else, they started hitting Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, with stones. Until Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, fell from the horse's back onto the land of Karbala. No, no, not onto the land of Karbala, but onto the points of arrows. The wretched ones pressed Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, with such force that the arrows emerged from his back. Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, rolled over. Now, the cry that came, when Zaynab, peace be upon her, saw that her brother was not visible, Zaynab, peace be upon her, came to this high ground, which you call `Tall-e Zaynabiya` when you visit Karbala, `Tall-e Zaynabiya`. On this mound, Zaynab, peace be upon her, stood and looked, what a sight she saw! Imam Mahdi, peace be upon him, says that Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, was lying down,
> وَ شِمرُونَ جَاْلِسُُ عَلٰی صَدرِہِ
> and Shimr was sitting on his chest.
- [Reference needed]

Zaynab, peace be upon her, could do nothing, so she said, "O son of Sa'd, you are watching my master. My master is being slaughtered." As soon as Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, heard her voice, he gestured, "Zaynab. Zaynab, go back from here." It is written in the `Maqtal` that Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, tried to get up twice. But he could not rise, so he gestured with his hands. Zaynab, peace be upon her, obeyed the Imam's command from the `Maqtal`, returned to the tent, and as soon as she stepped into the tent, the earth of Karbala began to tremble. The sun was eclipsed. Storms began to rage. The water of the Euphrates splashed from the spears. A voice echoed:
> الاء. و قتلو الحسین و بکربلا
> Behold! And they killed Hussain in Karbala!
- [Reference needed]
> الاء. ذبح الحسین بکربلا
> Behold! Hussain was slaughtered in Karbala!
- [Reference needed]

Zaynab, peace be upon her, asked, "Son, Sayyid Sajjad, peace be upon him, what kind of voice is this?" He said, "Aunt, please remove the tent curtain." Now, when the curtain was removed, what did they see? That Imam Hussain's head was raised on a long spear. Sayyid Sajjad, peace be upon him, said,
> السلام علیک یا ابا عبداللہ
> Peace be upon you, O Abul Abdullah.
- [Reference needed]

"Peace be upon you, O Abul Abdullah. Father, you were martyred, and I remained alive."
> لعنۃ اللہ علی القوم الظالمین
> May the curse of Allah be upon the unjust people.

| Principle                          | Essence                                                                                                                               |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Embracing Forgiveness (`Afw`)**  | A core prophetic practice and ethical command to continually forgive others and deal with them gently and mildly.                   |
| **Enjoining Good (`Ma'ruf`)**      | Commanding and performing deeds that are accepted by reason and bring pleasure, rooted in accordance with human nature (fitra).       |
| **Wilayat of Ahlul Bayt as `Ma'ruf`**| The love and obedience to the Ahlul Bayt is the foremost manifestation of `Ma'ruf`, leading to natural adoption of their teachings.   |
| **Shia Identity and Character**    | Shias are ambassadors of the Ahlul Bayt; their character should be an adornment (`Zayn`) for the Imams, not a source of disgrace.     |
| **Purity of Birth**                | The ability to connect deeply with the Ahlul Bayt, particularly through mourning rituals (`Azaadari`), is linked to purity of birth.  |
| **Avoiding Wasteful Actions**      | Certain actions are unproductive or detrimental, including doing good to those who misuse it, seeking benefit in unfavorable conditions (like a lamp in moonlight), eating excessively, and doing good to the undeserving. |
| **Humility in Charity**            | Charity and good deeds are invalidated by reminding others of the favor (`mann`) or causing harm (`adha`), akin to performing deeds for show (`riya`). |
| **Forgetting Your Own Good Deeds** | The benefactor should forget the good they did to prevent reminding others, a sign of `kam-zarf` (small-heartedness).                   |
| **Remembering Kindness Received**  | The recipient of kindness, no matter how small (even being taught a single letter), should remember the favor and the benefactor's right. |
| **Allah's Self-Sufficiency and Forbearance** | Allah does not need human actions, including charity. His `Hilm` (forbearance) is immense, delaying punishment despite transgression. |
| **Pure Love and Loyalty to Ahlul Bayt** | Genuine, unwavering love and loyalty, demonstrated by companions like Amr ibn Hamiq and Uways al-Qarani, is paramount and distinct from opportunistic allegiance. |
| **Consequences of Oppression**     | The practice of beheading enemies and parading heads, initiated by the enemies of the Ahlul Bayt, reflects a deep moral degradation that continued to Karbala. |
| **Remembering Hussain's Thirst**   | A specific command from Imam Hussain (A.S.) to his Shias to remember his thirst whenever they drink cool water, connecting their daily lives to his sacrifice. |
| **Submission to the Divine Will**  | Imam Hussain's (A.S.) ultimate surrender to Allah's call despite his suffering demonstrates complete submission (`Mutma'innah`).           |
| **Condemnation of Injustice**      | Invoking curses upon oppressors (`Za'limeen`) is a necessary stance against injustice, highlighted by the events of Karbala.            |
