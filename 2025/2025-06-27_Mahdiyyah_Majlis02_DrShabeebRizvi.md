### The Call of Karbala and the Salutation upon the Prophet's Family

O Allah, O Allah, send another salutation upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them.

#### An Evocation of Karbala's Tragedy

O moon, O moon of Karbala, you must have seen them, the stars of the highest heaven descended upon this land. O moon, O moon, the moon of Hashim is radiant, or else take charity of light from here. O moon, O moon, always keep this land cool, for those who sleep here are the beloved of Zahra, peace be upon her. O moon, these are the masters of Tasnim, the spring of Kawthar, who were killed thirsty on the bank of this river. O moon, brave ones like Hurr and Habib, and friends, the helpers of the king were killed right here. O moon, and Qasim's body was being trampled in the battlefield, while Abbas and the master were picking up his pieces. O moon, and the arms of the loyal Abbas were cut off here, he did not get permission to fight, nor could he bring water. O moon, and the master brought a beautiful woman to give water, but the wretched Harmala shot your arrow of tyranny. O moon, the neck was pierced on the head, the arm was pierced on the father, both writhed in agony and passed away thirsty from the world. O moon, and in this forest, a little girl was searching for her father, when the headless bodies were scattered. O moon, then you also saw that grief-stricken girl sleeping on the chest, clinging to her headless father. And the arms of the family of the Prophet, peace be upon them, were tied here in the first watch of the night, Sajjad passed through this land with his head bowed. O moon, and the prince of both worlds is the master of Karbala, the prince of both worlds is the master of Karbala, who has the audacity to come until he calls? And those who have reached Karbala are the descendants of Ja'far, O would that fate show them this heartache. O moon of Karbala, send salutations upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them.

#### Initial Supplications

The prayer and peace be upon the noblest of the prophets and messengers, the beloved of the God of the worlds, Abu al-Qasim Muhammad, peace be upon him and his holy family, the infallible ones from whom Allah has removed all impurity and purified them with a thorough purification. O Allah, send blessings upon our master and our lady, the remnant of Allah, the Imam of our time, our guardian, our beloved, our master, our beloved, and our proof, and upon Ali, peace be upon him, the refuge of the helpless and the straight path, may the souls of the worlds be sacrificed for him.

Thereafter, our master and leader, Al-Hussain ibn Ali, peace be upon them, said:

ŸÖŸéŸÜŸí ÿπŸéÿ®ŸéÿØŸé ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸé ÿ≠ŸéŸÇŸéŸë ÿπŸêÿ®ŸéÿßÿØŸéÿ™ŸêŸáŸê
- [Reference needed]

(Whoever worships Allah as He deserves to be worshipped, Allah will give him more than he desires and suffices.)

Our master, Al-Hussain ibn Ali, peace be upon them, has spoken the truth. Blessings of Allah be upon him.

### The Essence of Worship and Recognition (Ma'rifah)

The noble hadith that has been chosen for the discussion of this decade, in this hadith, the Master of Martyrs, Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, says:

ŸÖŸéŸÜŸí ÿπŸéÿ®ŸéÿØŸé ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸé ÿ≠ŸéŸÇŸéŸë ÿπŸêÿ®ŸéÿßÿØŸéÿ™ŸêŸáŸê
- [Reference needed]

(Whoever worships Allah as He deserves to be worshipped)

This means, whoever worships Allah in the way that is the right of worship, the right of worship, meaning, in the way that it should be done, which is the right way to worship. If someone does it like that, then:

ÿ¢ÿ™ŸéÿßŸáŸè ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸè ŸÅŸéŸàŸíŸÇŸé ÿ£ŸéŸÖŸéÿßŸÜŸêŸäŸáŸê ŸàŸéŸÉŸêŸÅŸéÿßŸäŸéÿ™ŸêŸáŸê
- [Reference needed]

(Allah will give him more than his desires and his needs.)

Allah will give him more than his desires, more than his needs, what he cannot even think of, that thing cannot even come to his mind, Allah will grant him that, in this world and in the hereafter. Remember, in this world too, it is not that Allah leaves His sincere servants alone in this world; no, Allah is always with them, because they worship Allah in the way that is the right of worship.

#### The Foundation: Worshiping Allah as He Deserves

And what is the right of worship? The fundamental thing is, first, to have Ma'rifat (Recognition or knowledge). This Ma'rifah is what we talked about yesterday, the basic discussion we had yesterday.

#### Priority to Allah's Commands

The summary of yesterday's discussion was that in everything, give preference to Allah. Give preference to Allah, not to your desires, not to your emotions, but to prefer Allah, to give priority to Allah, to give priority to Allah's command, to give priority to Allah's orders and prohibitions. This is called the right of worship.

### The Primacy and Limits of Intellect (`Aql`)

Yesterday, I had some more discussions with you about the intellect.

#### Intellect as the Path to Worship and Paradise

The intellect is such an important thing that Allah has distributed among His servants. And this is the intellect through which paradise is attained, the intellect is that through which Allah is worshipped. When the narrator asked the Imam about the intellect, the Imam said the same thing:

ÿßŸÑŸíÿπŸéŸÇŸíŸÑŸè ŸÖŸéÿß ÿπŸèÿ®ŸêÿØŸé ÿ®ŸêŸáŸê ÿßŸÑÿ±ŸéŸëÿ≠ŸíŸÖŸéŸÜŸè ŸàŸéÿßŸÉŸíÿ™Ÿèÿ≥Ÿêÿ®Ÿé ÿ®ŸêŸáŸê ÿßŸÑŸíÿ¨ŸêŸÜŸéÿßŸÜŸè
- [Reference needed]

(The intellect is that by which the Most Merciful is worshipped and by which paradise is earned.)

The intellect is that through which Allah is worshipped, the Most Merciful is worshipped, and through it, paradise is attained. A person will go to paradise through the intellect. This means that the right of worship, which we are talking about, can only be fulfilled by those who benefit from the light of their intellect, who use the light of their intellect, who use their intellect. This is such a great bounty that Allah has given them, they use it. When they use the light of their intellect, use their intellect, that is why the foundation of all our discussions should be on the light of the intellect.

#### The Intellect's Boundaries in Divine Matters

But remember that we are not like the Mu'tazilites, or like some theologians. Some Mu'tazilites and some theologians, even among our own, are such that they say that we do not accept what does not come to our intellect. This attitude is wrong because Allah has also set a limit for the intellect. He has set a limit for the intellect. The intellect has a limit.

##### Divine Existence vs. Divine Attributes

For example, in Tawhid (Monotheism), what is the limit of the intellect? In Tawhid, the limit of the intellect is only that it can prove the existence of Allah. That Allah exists, there is a creator, a creator who has created us. But can the intellect now tell the details of this creator? The intellect can never tell the details of this creator. That is, a person can understand the details of that creator only as much as that creator introduces himself. A person cannot understand more than that.

###### The Example of a Building

Let me give an example, a very quick example, and then move on, because the topic is very vast, very extensive. For example, if you see a building, then by looking at the building, you only understand two things. First, this building has a maker. It has a maker, meaning there is a builder, an engineer, whoever it is, who has made this building. This is what your intellect says, that this building did not come into existence on its own. If someone tells you that this building was built on its own, you will say that he is crazy. Not a building, even a small thing, if this tissue paper is in front of you, which is exactly with its dimensions and very precise, when it cannot come into existence on its own, then how can this whole universe come into existence? So the intellect says that no, there is definitely someone who has created it.

The second thing you can say by looking at the building is that whoever built the building, you can either say that the designer is very amazing, the engineer, the architect is very amazing, he has designed the building very well. The architect is very good, the engineer is very good, a very strong builder. Not more than that. Can you know anything else about the building or, sorry, about that engineer, about that architect, about that builder? That he seems very amazing, his morals are very good, his character is very good, he seems to be very amazing in religious education. Now whatever comes to your mind, it will surely be wrong. This was about Tawhid.

##### Intellect and Justice

Similarly, in the chapter of justice, it is the same. The intellect says that a person is free in all his actions, that is why there should be reward and punishment, there should be accountability. If someone says that no, a person is not free in his actions and he is compelled, then you will say that he is talking nonsense. What kind of talk is this? If a person is compelled, like a robot, and he has no choice, no freedom, then for that person, paradise and hell are wrong. For him, command and prohibition are wrong. You cannot tell him to pray, to fast. You cannot tell him, and if he does not pray, he will be punished. It is not like that. It is not like that. Anyway, that is the discussion of justice.

##### Intellect and Prophethood

Similarly, in prophethood, that is, how much role does the intellect have? As I told you yesterday, that in prophethood, the intellect can only do so much as to tell who is the true prophet and who is the false prophet.

###### Distinguishing True from False Prophets

You go to the prophet, are you a prophet? Yes, I am a prophet. Show me a miracle. Show me a miracle. Do you have a sign from Allah? Has it come? Is there a miracle? Is there a Sultan (authority)? Is there a Burhan (proof)? Is there a Daleel (evidence)? Tell me, bring some proof. So he will show the proof, and that proof should be such that no one else can do it. If he says my proof is that I remain silent, then is this any proof? Your eyes say that he is making a fool of us. And that is why you see, so many false babas who become babas today, and their miracles, they are exposed everywhere. Because a sign of Allah's verse and clear proof, that is, a miracle, is that the prophet, first of all, does not learn from anyone, does not study in any madrasa. And the second thing is that this prophet can do the work that you say, not what he has practiced.

###### The Miracle of Prophet Salih's She-Camel

That is why Hazrat Salih, a prophet, peace be upon our prophet and upon him, his people said to him that if you are a prophet, then bring such a she-camel from the mountain. From the mountain, a she-camel. See their demand too, how it was. That is, there used to be such people of the nation of the prophets. That is, do not be surprised by seeing the people of today that, oh, people today are not like this. No, no, people have always been like this. That is, people have been like this since the time of Cain, they are like this until today, and they will remain like this until the reappearance. So do not be surprised at all. That is why the Quran has condemned the majority. The Quran has condemned the majority. How many verses of the Quran you read, the Quran has condemned the majority. In fact, Allah has even addressed the Messenger of Allah and said, "O Prophet, if you follow this majority, then this majority will lead you astray from the path of Allah." But the system of the world runs on the majority, that we believe in democracy. Now see, the system of the world is completely upside down. It is upside down, the system itself is completely upside down. So now, what can be done about it? Nothing can be done now. God willing, everything will be fine after the reappearance. Recite a salawat for Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them.

So the prophet is also like that. Oh, if the people of Hazrat Salih said that we want such a she-camel to come out of the mountain, and then they also set a condition, and this she-camel should be such that it comes directly from the mountain, not from a male and female camel, and this she-camel, this she-camel should also be pregnant. They also set this condition. Now tell me, even if a she-camel is born to someone, directly from a male and female camel, how will she herself be pregnant? But what did Hazrat Salih do? He was a prophet. He sat down and prayed two rak'ahs of prayer. As soon as he prayed two rak'ahs of prayer, he prayed to Allah, and his prayer was answered. Allah answered his prayer. The boulder, which was a very big mountain, burst with a loud noise, and a very large she-camel came out. So Hazrat Salih introduced it, saying, "Look, this is a miracle of Allah." That is, it has come in the verse of the Quran, this is a clear proof. In the terminology of the Quran, it has come, has it not, a miracle? The word "miracle" has never come in the Quran, that is, in this meaning, in the meaning of a sign, the word "miracle" has never come. This word "miracle" came much later, about 125-150 years after Islam. That is, it was not there among the Muslims before, it came later, and it was brought by outsiders. But anyway, then it became so common that it gradually came into our traditions and hadiths as well. This is called "Naql bil-Ma'na" (Narration by Meaning) in the terminology of hadith.

###### The Wretchedness of the Killers of Divine Signs

Anyway, so now it came, they said this is a sign from Allah. So look, do not kill it, do not harm it. Hazrat Salih said, but where was that nation going to listen? Just as we do not listen to our prophet today, they did not listen to their prophet. They killed that she-camel. The one who killed it, his name was, the main culprit was Qaddar ibn Salif. Qaddar ibn Salif was his name, who killed the she-camel of Hazrat Salih. So he is called "Ashqa al-Awwalin" (the most wretched of the ancients). That is, among the ancient people, the most wretched person was this Qaddar ibn Salif, because he killed the sign of Allah.

###### Ali (`A.S.`) as the Grand Sign of Allah

And who is "Ashqa al-Akhirin" (the most wretched of the later ones)? It is Ibn Muljam, may Allah curse him, who martyred the last, that is, the greatest sign in the last era, that is, the Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him. He martyred the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him. That is why he is called "Ashqa al-Akhirin". That is, the one who is the most wretched and the most cursed in the last nation is this Ibn Muljam. Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him, who is he? Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him, who is the "Ayatollah al-Udhma" (the Grand Sign of Allah), the "Ayatollah al-Kubra" (the Greatest Sign of Allah), is Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him. In the Ziyarat (Visitations), this title is for Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him. "Ayatollah al-Udhma" is the title of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him. The greatest sign of Allah. See, all are signs, from a particle to the Pleiades, that is, to the very pinnacle of the universe, all these are the signs of Allah, the verses of Allah. But the "Ayatollah al-Udhma" is the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him. The meaning of "Udhma" is the greatest, because "Ayah" in Arabic is feminine, that is why "Udhma" is feminine, the gender that is used in Arabic is like that. So, "Ayatollah," the greatest sign of Allah, is the Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace and blessings be upon him. Just like that, see, the intellect works.

### The Imperative of Imamate

Now the matter of Imamate has come. I have told you that the Imam should also be like the prophet. Just as the prophet is, the Imam should be.

#### The Imam as Successor to the Prophet

Because, that is, it is a very, what do you call it, a very basic principle, a basic principle, that if in a company, the managing director retires or resigns, or whatever, then who will come in his place? A managing director will come, with the same qualifications, or will a peon come? Now after the prophet, the one who will be the successor of the prophet, will he be like the prophet or not? Any Tom, Dick, or Harry, they say, he looks like this, let's make him sit. Will he be? No, he should be like the prophet.

#### The Miracles (`Mu'jizat`) of the Imams

Now what were the characteristics of the prophet? The prophet had power, he had clear signs. The Imams also had such signs. And the Imams regularly, that is, showed miracles. For the sake of ease, we are saying "miracle". They showed these miracles. Our scholars have written books on this topic. That is, both partial and complete books. Partial means a chapter within a large book, for example, a whole chapter is on miracles. In fact, besides this, in the fifth century, there was a very great scholar whose name was Husayn ibn al-Shaykh al-Husayn ibn Abd al-Wahhab. He wrote this book, "Uyun al-Mu'jizat" (Springs of Miracles), and in it, he narrated miracles. And who collected more details and details on it? Sayyid Hashim al-Bahrani. He wrote it in five volumes, "Madinat al-Ma'ajiz" (The City of Miracles). That is, the cities of miracles. That is, the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them, are the cities of miracles. This is a city.

##### The Authenticity of `Nad-e-Ali`

That is why when you say "Nad-e-Ali", you should teach it to your children. This new fashion has started these days that "Nad-e-Ali" should not be taught. Originally, our child knows Surah al-Hamd, Ayat al-Kursi, that is very good. That should also be taught, it should definitely be taught. But does your child know "Nad-e-Ali"? No, he does not know "Nad-e-Ali". That "Nad-e-Ali" is not authentic. Sir, before uttering such sentences, you should think a little about what we are saying. Are not some other secrets being revealed by this? That "Nad-e-Ali" is not authentic. No, no, "Nad-e-Ali" is 100% authentic. When the Prophet prayed to Allah for help, Allah commanded the Prophet:

ŸÜÿßÿØ ÿπŸÑŸäÿß
- [Reference needed]

(Call upon Ali.)

O Prophet, the Prophet is praying, to whom? To Allah. What is Allah saying? "O Prophet, O my beloved, call upon Ali." The Prophet called upon Ali. What is this Ali? He is "Mazhar al-Aja'ib" (the manifestation of wonders). "Mazhar al-aja'ib" means miracles personified. What is Ali, peace be upon him? Miracles personified. That is, the one at whose hands miracles continue to appear. Anyway, God willing, we will mention one miracle to you if there is time. So the intellect says that the Imam should also be like the prophet.

##### The Importance of Imam's Knowledge: An Example of `Tayammum`

It cannot be that the prophet is of a high rank and the Imam knows nothing, that in every small matter he says, "Well, call so-and-so, call so-and-so, I don't understand." They did not understand anything. And they would immediately give a fatwa too. They said, "Well, if there is no water, for example, what should we do? Should we pray?" They said, "Don't pray." Oh brother, what are you? Whose? Immediately, Mr. Ammar interrupted him. He interrupted him right there. He said, "What are you saying? Have you forgotten? We were both in the desert, and there we were both in a state where Ghusl (ritual bath) was obligatory on us. Ghusl was obligatory on us, but there was no water. So I, I remember that the Prophet said to do Tayammum (dry ablution). So I rolled in the dust." Mr. Ammar said. Mr. Ammar said, "I started rolling in the dust, and after rolling, I prayed. And when I told you, did you pray?" He said, "No, I did not pray because there is no water."

See, what we are telling you, we are talking with all references, yes. There is no reference to what. Okay? Everything, that too is not a Shia book. It is not a Shia book. If someone has this misunderstanding that we are giving references from Shia books, no, no, it is not a Shia book, but it is from the books of the opponents, from the books of the Ahl al-Sunnah. So he said, "Have you forgotten that matter?" So then when we came back to the Prophet, you had not even prayed. When we came to the Prophet, he said, "O Messenger of Allah," my Ammar said, "O Messenger of Allah, we were in this state that ghusl was obligatory on us, but there was no water, so I did tayammum like this." The Prophet said, "No, that is not the correct way of tayammum. The correct way is this." The Prophet showed the way. "But you did not even pray. And you are still giving the same fatwa, do not pray." Now what? The gentleman's honor was gone in front of everyone in the open court. Now what to do? So he said, "Have Ammar beaten." Ammar, the companion of the Prophet. He is a companion of the Prophet. And there are many such incidents. That is, not one. Mr. Mir Amir Husayn Hindi, may Allah be pleased with him, in his book "Aqat al-Anwar", brings hundreds, more than a hundred such incidents, more than a hundred, in which he was sitting and saying, "No, don't do it. It's okay. Don't pray. Don't do this work, don't do that work, it will be fine." Oh, it is the worship of Allah, how will it be fine? If you ask any Shia jurist in our community, even if he is not a Marja' (Source of Emulation), even if he is not a scholar, just a simple Mujtahid (one who can derive rulings) who reads the "Tawdih al-Masa'il" (Clarification of Rulings), who is a little familiar with the rulings, if you ask him too, can prayer be abandoned in any situation? He will say, "Never." If there is no water, then do it with tayammum, but you cannot abandon the prayer. Anyway, so the successor of the prophet should be like the prophet.

### The Quest for Truth (`Haqq`)

Now let's take the discussion further, quickly. Now see, it is obligatory for every person, whether he is of any religion, of any faith, of any sect, for everyone, yes, without exception, that he should search for the truth, search for the reality.

#### The Universal Obligation to Seek Truth

In everything, see, we are not just talking about any one sect, for example. This problem is with everyone. It is with us too. We too, often what happens is that we are not in search of the truth. We do what we see people doing, or what we understand, we do that. What is the truth? The truth is that which the Quran and the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them, have stated. Nothing else is the truth.

#### Conditions for Attaining Truth

So if someone wants to search for the truth, then there are some conditions for it. We will quickly state them to you in the light of the Quran and the hadith. You listen.

The first thing is, if a person searches for the truth, then he should pray to Allah, "O Lord, show me the truth." The truth is a very difficult thing. See, we are telling you again that it is easy to say, it is easy to listen, but to search for the truth, to find the truth, is very difficult, very difficult. It is a very difficult task. That is why the Prophet has told a standard of truth. See, this is the truth.

ÿπŸéŸÑŸêŸäŸåŸë ŸÖŸéÿπŸé ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéŸÇŸêŸë ŸàŸéÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéŸÇŸèŸë ŸÖŸéÿπŸé ÿπŸéŸÑŸêŸäŸçŸë
- [Reference needed]

(Ali is with the truth, and the truth is with Ali.)

ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸèŸÖŸéŸë ÿ£ŸéÿØŸêÿ±Ÿê ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéŸÇŸéŸë ŸÖŸéÿπŸéŸáŸè ÿ≠ŸéŸäŸíÿ´Ÿè ÿØŸéÿßÿ±Ÿé
- [Reference needed]

(O Allah, turn the truth with him wherever he turns.)

One person, one person has told that this is the truth. Now if someone wants to see the truth, then he should look at Ali. It is clear for everyone, it is clear. Now you see, what is the first condition?

##### 1. Sincerity (`Ikhlas`) and Purity

There should be sincerity. A person should have sincerity. That is, with a sincere heart, his intention should be pure. And for the intention to be pure, there are two important things. Two important things. If someone wants to keep his intention pure, one is that nothing forbidden should go into the mind. When something forbidden goes into the mind, what does it mean? It means that the thing that Allah has forbidden, the thing that Allah has prohibited, they are doing all those things, seeing, listening, reading. So it is obvious that when all the forbidden things, all the corruption is filled in a person's mind, the whole corruption is filled, then from where will that person search for the truth?

###### Avoiding Forbidden Sustenance and Thought

And the second thing is that no impure or forbidden thing should go into a person's stomach. No impure or forbidden thing should go. If he is eating something impure, the thing that Allah has forbidden, the thing that the Shari'ah has forbidden, then it is obvious that it will have an effect. If he is eating something forbidden, then it is obvious that it will have an effect. That is why in our community, the first, that is, the ruling in the hadith is that before starting any work, whether it is a job, or a profession, or a business, the first condition is that you should be aware of the jurisprudential laws. Meaning, the laws of Islam, you should know them. It is very important to know them. That is why it is found in the hadith:

ÿßŸÑŸíŸÅŸêŸÇŸíŸáŸè ÿ´ŸèŸÖŸéŸë ÿßŸÑŸíŸÖŸéÿ™Ÿíÿ¨Ÿéÿ±Ÿè
- [Reference needed]

(Jurisprudence, then business.)

First, acquire knowledge, then start the business. The business you are going to do, first see if it is forbidden or permissible, or what it is. Okay? Otherwise, then if a person may be very sincere, but he is ignorant, then this ignorant person who is sincere, he is very dangerous.

###### The Danger of Ignorant Devotion

The Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, says, "Two people have broken my back. They have broken my back." The Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, says. And the word he uses is:

ÿ•ŸêŸÜŸéŸëŸÖŸéÿß ŸÇŸéÿµŸéŸÖŸé ÿ∏ŸéŸáŸíÿ±ŸêŸä ÿßÿ´ŸíŸÜŸéÿßŸÜŸê
- [Reference needed]

(Indeed, two have broken my back.)

That is, they have broken it in such a way that you cannot join it. They have broken my back in such a way, two people. And who are those two people? See, these are the words of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, pay attention:

ÿπŸéÿßŸÑŸêŸÖŸå ŸÖŸèÿ™ŸéŸáŸéÿ™ŸêŸëŸÉŸå
- [Reference needed]

(A dissolute scholar.)

One is a scholar who is a scholar, but he does forbidden things very freely. He is dissolute. Or he does not protect his knowledge. He gives his knowledge to ineligible people. This is called "Mutahattik". The meaning of "Hatk" is to tear the curtain, to tear the curtain. So it has many meanings, which we do not have to explain now. We will just stop here for now. One is that scholar, and who is the second one?

ŸàŸéÿ¨ŸéÿßŸáŸêŸÑŸå ŸÖŸèÿ™ŸéŸÜŸéÿ≥ŸêŸëŸÉŸå
- [Reference needed]

(And an ignorant ascetic.)

That ignorant person who worships a lot, he has broken my back. That ignorant person who worships a lot, he is worshipping without knowledge. He is very harmful to the religion without knowledge.

###### The Kharijites and Their Ignorance in Siffin

Do you know that the people who, that is, this same Ibn Muljam, may Allah curse him, he was a Kharijite. These Kharijites, who were these people? You know, they were all among the soldiers of the master in Kufa, who killed the master. They were the soldiers of the master. After the Battle of Siffin, they separated. They used to worship so much that it is written in the books of history that their foreheads had become like the knees of a camel from worshipping, from worshipping. So much worship, but they were ignorant, they did not have Ma'rifah. And where was their ignorance revealed? In the Battle of Siffin. When the army of Mu'awiyah raised the Quran on the spears in the Battle of Siffin, these people started saying, "O Ali, look, these people have also raised the Quran. They also believe in the Quran. They also pray. Why do you fight with them?" The master explained that they have not raised the Quran, they are doing a trick. This is a conspiracy of theirs. The Quran has not gone down their throats. They do not understand the Quran. They do not know the Quran. The master wanted to explain that I am the Quran and the Quran is me, but these ignorant people did not understand anything. They surrounded Ali, peace be upon him, and put a sword on his head, all of them together, that now you, now stop this war. Stop the war now, otherwise we will kill you now. So the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, had to call back Malik al-Ashtar. Malik al-Ashtar had gone to the extent that he had reached the tent of Mu'awiyah. So when the message reached him, Malik al-Ashtar said, "Just give me a few more moments of respite. Give me a little time. I will go now and finish him off. The problem will be over." But the people said, "No, Ali ibn Abi Talib has said that if you want to see Ali alive, then come back now." So Malik al-Ashtar came back. And what was the result? The result was that he used these same Kharijites, whom Malik had gone to kill, he used them for what? To martyr Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him. To martyr Imam Hasan al-Mujtaba, peace be upon him. O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them.

###### Imam Husayn's Sermon on Forbidden Sustenance

The intention should be completely pure. The intention should be completely pure. And when will the intention be pure? When good things go into a person's mind and permissible things go into his stomach, not forbidden things. If forbidden things go, then his intention will be like that. That is why, what is it? That is why it is very clear that the Master of Martyrs said the same thing on the day of Ashura. You know, right? That the Master of Martyrs gave several sermons on the day of Ashura. After giving several sermons to the enemies, but they did not understand anything. They did not understand anything. So the Master of Martyrs did not say in the end that you do not understand this because your stomachs are full of forbidden things. Your stomachs are full of forbidden things. That is why you will not understand anything. So therefore, if someone does not understand anything, the reason is that his stomach is bad. Anyway, so this is one thing, that his intention should be pure.

###### The Hadith on Pure Earnings and Answered Prayers

See, let me quickly tell you a short hadith, then we will come to the second point. Imam Sadiq, peace and blessings be upon him, says:

ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸèŸÖŸéŸë ÿµŸéŸÑŸêŸë ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸâ ŸÖŸèÿ≠ŸéŸÖŸéŸëÿØŸç ŸàŸéÿ¢ŸÑŸê ŸÖŸèÿ≠ŸéŸÖŸéŸëÿØŸç
- [Reference needed]

(O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them.)

ÿ•Ÿêÿ∞Ÿéÿß ÿ£Ÿéÿ±ŸéÿßÿØŸé ÿ£Ÿéÿ≠ŸéÿØŸèŸÉŸèŸÖŸí ÿ£ŸéŸÜŸí ŸäŸèÿ≥Ÿíÿ™Ÿéÿ¨Ÿéÿßÿ®Ÿé ŸÑŸéŸáŸè ŸÅŸéŸÑŸíŸäŸèÿ∑ŸéŸäŸêŸëÿ®Ÿí ŸÉŸéÿ≥Ÿíÿ®ŸéŸáŸè ŸàŸéŸÑŸíŸäŸéÿÆŸíÿ±Ÿèÿ¨Ÿí ŸÖŸêŸÜŸí ŸÖŸéÿ∏ŸéÿßŸÑŸêŸÖŸê ÿßŸÑŸÜŸéŸëÿßÿ≥Ÿê ŸàŸéÿ•ŸêŸÜŸéŸë ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸé ŸÑŸéÿß ŸäŸéÿ±ŸíŸÅŸéÿπŸè ÿ•ŸêŸÑŸéŸäŸíŸáŸê ÿØŸèÿπŸéÿßÿ°Ÿé ÿπŸéÿ®ŸíÿØŸç ŸàŸéŸÅŸêŸä ÿ®Ÿéÿ∑ŸíŸÜŸêŸáŸê ÿ≠Ÿéÿ±ŸéÿßŸÖŸå ÿ£ŸéŸàŸí ÿπŸêŸÜŸíÿØŸéŸáŸè ŸÖŸéÿ∏ŸíŸÑŸéŸÖŸéÿ©Ÿå ŸÑŸêÿ£Ÿéÿ≠ŸéÿØŸç ŸÖŸêŸÜŸí ÿÆŸéŸÑŸíŸÇŸêŸáŸê
- [Reference needed]

(If one of you wants his prayer to be answered, let him purify his earnings and let him get out of the injustices of the people, for indeed, Allah does not raise to Himself the prayer of a servant in whose stomach is something forbidden or who has an injustice against one of His creatures.)

That is, if a person wants a fatwa, an edict, a judgment from Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, if someone wants, a fatwa-giver, by fatwa here it is not meant only the fatwa that the Mujtahids give, but this is for everyone. If you want to ask something from Allah seriously, seriously, the Imam says that what is the condition for it? That his inner self should be pure. His inner self should be pure.

###### Purity of Intention in Deeds

The second is what?

ŸàŸéÿÆŸéŸÑŸéÿµŸé ÿπŸéŸÖŸéŸÑŸèŸáŸè
- [Reference needed]

(And his deeds are pure.)

And his deeds should also be pure. There should be no hypocrisy, no show-off in that deed. There should be no showing off. Even a little bit of show-off, showing off, hypocrisy, then his deed is useless. And it has been called "Shirk Khafi" (hidden polytheism) in our community. That is, in which a person does it to show others. And the third thing is this:

ŸàŸéÿ£ŸéÿπŸíŸÑŸéŸÜŸé
- [Reference needed]

(And he announced.)

The work he is doing openly should also be done with a pure intention. For example, this mourning that we are doing, this mourning, whoever does it, should do it with a pure intention. There should not be even a little bit of showing off, no hypocrisy in it. There should not be even a little bit of such a thing that, oh, if so-and-so comes, then there will be mourning, if so-and-so does not come, then there will be no mourning. If so many people come, then so many, if not, then no. All these things are not there. Mourning means there should be a pure intention. So he says, and after that:

ÿ®Ÿèÿ±ŸíŸáŸéÿßŸÜŸè
- [Reference needed]

(Proof.)

The Imam says, then after that, in every situation, he should expect light from his Lord. He should expect that light which will come from his Lord, provided that he is completely pure, chaste.

##### 2. Freedom from Prejudice (`Asabiyyah`)

What is the second thing? The Imam says that in this, that is, what is the condition for receiving this faith, for attaining the truth? That a person should not have prejudice. There should be no prejudice. What is prejudice called? It is also called "Asabiyyah" in Arabic. In Urdu, it is called "Ta'assub". In English, it is called "prejudice".

###### The Definition of Prejudice

What is the meaning of prejudice? The meaning of prejudice is that we know that this thing is right. But because it is not in our favor, that is why we say it is wrong. This is called prejudice. This thing is going against one of our relatives, so we take the side of our relative and say that no, this thing is wrong. Why? It is going against our relative. It is going against our tribe. It is going against our friend. It is going against our country. That is why we say it is wrong. No, wrong is wrong, and right is right.

###### Quranic Condemnation of Denying the Truth

And this was the reason that whenever people mentioned the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them, what was the result? The result was that the nation became a victim of "Asabiyyah". A victim of prejudice. We will not let the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them, come, no matter what happens. We will not accept the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them. That is why I will quickly read two verses of the Quran to you. One is verse 32 of Surah al-Zumar, in which Allah the Almighty says:

ŸÅŸéŸÖŸéŸÜŸí ÿ£Ÿéÿ∏ŸíŸÑŸéŸÖŸè ŸÖŸêŸÖŸéŸëŸÜŸí ŸÉŸéÿ∞Ÿéÿ®Ÿé ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸê ŸàŸéŸÉŸéÿ∞ŸéŸëÿ®Ÿé ÿ®ŸêÿßŸÑÿµŸêŸëÿØŸíŸÇŸê ÿ•Ÿêÿ∞Ÿí ÿ¨Ÿéÿßÿ°ŸéŸáŸè
- [Quran, Surah Az-Zumar 39:32]

(So who is more unjust than one who lies about Allah? And denies the truth when it has come to him?)

Who is more unjust than him? What word has Allah used? "Zalim" (unjust). Who is more unjust, that is, unjust, than him? Who attributes a lie to Allah. That is, he says false things about Allah. And two, "And denies the truth when it has come to him." When "Sidq", "Sidq" means truth, reality, when the truth comes to him, he denies it on the basis of his "Asabiyyah", on the basis of his prejudice. He says, "No, I will not accept it." Why? It is going against me. So if a Shia presents something, he says, "No, we do not accept the words of the Shias." Why don't you accept them? Because the Shias have "Sihr al-Bayan" (magic of speech). There is magic in their speech. Oh brother, you prove the magic. And if you are so much on the side of the truth, then break this magic. You prove it is magic, we will not accept it. And we have the antidote for it. But what do they do? They take the help of lies, and then in this way, they make people corrupt. They corrupt the minds of the people, the beliefs of the people.

In the second verse, Allah says, the same verse, the same, just the wording at the end, one word has just changed. This is verse 68 of Surah al-Ankabut. Allah says:

ŸàŸéŸÖŸéŸÜŸí ÿ£Ÿéÿ∏ŸíŸÑŸéŸÖŸè ŸÖŸêŸÖŸéŸëŸÜŸê ÿßŸÅŸíÿ™Ÿéÿ±ŸéŸâ ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸê ŸÉŸéÿ∞Ÿêÿ®Ÿãÿß ÿ£ŸéŸàŸí ŸÉŸéÿ∞ŸéŸëÿ®Ÿé ÿ®ŸêÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéŸÇŸêŸë ŸÑŸéŸÖŸéŸëÿß ÿ¨Ÿéÿßÿ°ŸéŸáŸè
- [Quran, Surah Al-Ankabut 29:68]

(And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah? Or denies the truth when it has come to him?)

This is also there. In the first verse, it was "kadhaba 'ala Allah". Two words have changed. In the verse above, it was "kadhaba 'ala Allah". In this verse, it is "Iftara 'ala Allah". Who attributes a lie to Allah. "Iftira" means to attribute something that is not there. To say something that is not there. This is to attribute a lie to Allah. He attributes a lie to Allah. Has a lie been attributed to Allah or not? A lot has been done. If we start telling you the list of it, start stating the list, then for that, at least another decade is needed. Not a majlis, a decade. Not one majlis, at least 10 majlis, in which we just tell the list of how much lies were attributed to Allah after the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. So many false things. Anyway, that is a separate topic. So here the Quran says, "And who is more unjust than one who attributes a lie to Allah?" "Or denies the truth when it has come to him."

###### The Ahlul Bayt's Efforts to Establish Truth After the Prophet's Demise

Now we have already told you who the truth is. The truth is Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him. The Quran is saying that the one to whom Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him, comes to ask for his right, and he denies Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him, there is no one more unjust than him. For three days after the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him, Lady Zahra, peace be upon her, and Ali Muhammad, for three days continuously, for three days, they kept going to the house of every Muhajir and Ansar, knocking on the door. Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him, Lady Zahra with him, Imam Hasan and Imam Husayn, peace be upon them, with him. That is, all the members of the Mubahala with him. Whose truthfulness, whose truth, whose truthfulness Allah has testified to. Allah has said that they are truthful. And whoever comes against them, the curse of Allah is upon him. For three days, these people of Mubahala, that is, these people of Mubahala who had come, who had come to the field of Mubahala, whom the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, had brought with him, they kept knocking on the door of every single Muhajir and every single Ansar. But everyone made excuses.

###### The Distortion of Truth in History

If you read the books of the opponents, then you will see what is written in them. Someone said, "O Ali, you have come too late." Someone said, "Ali, we will come tomorrow." Someone did not even open the door. They did not even talk. What do we know about all this? These are the matters of great people. These are the matters of two great people. You hear all these sentences, right? This is what has been going on in Islam. And this is what went on. When the war between Yazid and Imam Hussain took place, the same thing was said, that this is a war between two great people. That is why Dabir Sitpuri, may he rest in peace, said that this is Karbala. If it is a war of princes, then if there is power in the pen, then write that Hussain lost. This is what has been going on in Islam. The Quran has said that the most unjust people are these. They are the most unjust people. There is no one more unjust than them. Why? Because they denied that truth whose confirmation, whose verification Allah has done, whose declaration the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, has done. The hadith of truth, we have already told you. The event of Mubahala is its proof. Besides this, there is the sermon of Ghadir, and as many hadiths as you say are present. But in everything, prejudice plays a big role. Prejudice, in everything, what does it say? Prejudice, what does it say? "No, no, this was not their meaning. Their meaning was that. This meaning, that meaning." In this way, by saying this and that, they dismiss the matter.

Now you see, let's take the matter further. This was the second thing.

##### 3. Striving (`Jihad`) in the Path of Allah

What is the third condition? These are the three conditions for searching for the truth. First, I told you, sincerity, purity of the inner self, purity. Second, there should be no prejudice. And what is the third thing? The third thing is that a person should work hard in it, he should strive. Then he will find the truth. Allah has promised in the Quran:

ŸàŸéÿßŸÑŸéŸëÿ∞ŸêŸäŸÜŸé ÿ¨ŸéÿßŸáŸéÿØŸèŸàÿß ŸÅŸêŸäŸÜŸéÿß ŸÑŸéŸÜŸéŸáŸíÿØŸêŸäŸéŸÜŸéŸëŸáŸèŸÖŸí ÿ≥Ÿèÿ®ŸèŸÑŸéŸÜŸéÿß
- [Quran, Surah Al-Ankabut 29:69]

(And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways.)

The people who strive in Our way, work hard, endure hardship, tolerate, then surely, certainly, We will guide them to the straight path. We will guide them on Our path. "We will surely guide them to Our ways." We will guide them on Our paths, We will tell them that this path is Our path, this is Our path. If someone really works hard in the way of Allah, puts in effort, then Allah will show him the way. These are the three conditions. Until a person fulfills these three conditions, he will not come to the straight path.

### Love (`Hubb`) as a Pillar of Faith

And that is why the first sign of faith that has been told, we will just give a hint, we will tell a story quickly to you, which Shaykh Husayn ibn Abd al-Wahhab has narrated in "Uyun al-Mu'jizat". And because he was a very great Muhaddith (Narrator of Hadith), it is written in the books before his name, "al-Muhaddith al-Kabir" (the great narrator of hadith) or "al-Allamah al-Kabir al-Muhaddith al-Jalil" (the great, noble scholar and narrator of hadith). A very great scholar of the fifth century, a scholar of the fifth century. A very great scholar. He has narrated the incident.

#### Love for Truth and Ahlul Bayt as a Condition of Faith

But before that, let me tell you that what is a very important condition for reaching faith? And that is to love the truth. Subhanallah (Glory be to God). A person should love the truth. He should make himself in such a way that he loves the truth. Until he does this, he will not get the truth. If there is hesitation in his mind, hesitation means hesitation, that if the truth comes before him, should he accept it or not? This means that there is a doubt somewhere, there is no purity, there is a problem somewhere. But if it becomes known that no, it is the truth, for example, if the hadith becomes known that:

ÿπŸéŸÑŸêŸäŸåŸë ŸÖŸéÿπŸé ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéŸÇŸêŸë
- [Reference needed]

(Ali is with the truth.)

Ali is with the truth. Now loving Ali has become a condition of faith. A condition of faith. What is the condition of belief, the condition of faith? It is the love of Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace be upon him. Loving Ali is a condition of faith. That is why the narrator came and asked the Imam, he asked, "Is love a part of faith?" The Imam replied:

ŸáŸéŸÑŸê ÿßŸÑÿØŸêŸëŸäŸÜŸè ÿ•ŸêŸÑŸéŸëÿß ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠Ÿèÿ®ŸèŸë ŸàŸéÿßŸÑŸíÿ®Ÿèÿ∫Ÿíÿ∂Ÿè
- [Reference needed]

(Is religion anything other than love and hate?)

Is religion anything other than love and hate, that is, friendship and love for the truth and enmity for falsehood is the name of religion. Subhanallah, Subhanallah. This is necessary. It is not that we like this one too, we like that one too, we love both. This is not right.

#### The Imam's Ruling on Dual Loyalties

That is why the Imam said, that is, a man came to the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, and said, "I love you too, and I also love those who have usurped your right." The Imam replied to him in one answer, what did he say? This is the answer of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him. See, it is not ours. If someone has a problem with us, he will not accept our words, brother, right? But the words of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, should not be rejected, right? So the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, said, "Right now you are one-eyed. You are one-eyed. Either become two-eyed or become completely blind. This will not do." That is, either have both love and enmity, that is, love us and have enmity with our enemies, or become completely of our enemies. Go completely to that side, no problem. At least it will be known that this one is from this side. This one who walks on both this side and that side and makes a fool of people, that should not be.

#### The Efficacy of Love for Ali (`A.S.`)

And remember that this love of Ali, it is very useful. It is very useful. It comes in very handy. Let me quickly narrate an incident to you. He has also narrated this incident in the miracles. I will narrate this same incident to you.

##### The Miraculous Survival of a Sinner

A person came to the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, at the time when he had his apparent government, his apparent government. The Imam had a government in Kufa, and the master was sitting on the judge's chair in the Dar al-Qada (House of Justice). And he said, "O Ali, I love you, master. I am your admirer." Now the master is a judge at that time, remember that, he is a judge. He said, "I love you very much, but I have committed a very big sin. I have been committing this sin for a long time." Now that sin was such that it is not appropriate to mention it in this gathering, we think. But it is in the hadith. If anyone wants it, you can take it from us. He said such a sin. The master asked, "What is your sin?" The master, he said, "Master, this is my sin." Oh, a very big sin, really severe, tremendous. The master said, "Your punishment is very severe. Now I can give you three punishments. You can select one option out of three. One, I will cut off your neck with my Dhu'l-Fiqar. Two, I will crush you against the wall, as in today's language, I will bulldoze you. That is, for example, I will make a whole wall fall on you and kill you." He had committed such a big sin. "And three, I will burn you in the fire." He said, "Master, I am most afraid of fire." Listen to his answer. "I am most afraid of fire. That is why you should burn me with fire, so that I may die by burning, so that when I go to the hereafter, I may go without sin." The master gave the order to Ammar to collect wood. Tomorrow, after the Fajr prayer, he will be burned. He has to be burned after the Fajr prayer.

Now the news spread in Kufa that, well, this was a lover of Ali, he committed this sin, Ali said that, well, burn him, burn him with fire. He will be burned in the morning. Now you know that in Kufa, most of them were also the enemies of Ali, peace be upon him. You know, right? The majority of Kufa was the enemy of Ali. They did not love Ali. That is, there were many Shias too, there was a large number of Shias in Kufa, but there were also many enemies of Ali. Now they all started talking among themselves that we used to hear hadiths in their community that fire will not burn the lover of Ali. Now here Ali himself is burning him. Ali himself is burning him. Okay, a thousand pieces of wood were ordered, 1000 wooden logs, and a pile of all of them was made, and then he was placed on top of it. Okay? When he was placed on it, now the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, is going to set fire to the wood. But before setting it, he says, "You came and what did you say? You love me. Now this wood will tell whether you love me or not." Now it is written in the hadith that the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, set fire to the wood. The fire started in the wood. You think, a thousand pieces of wood, you know, right? How much is a thousand logs of wood? Now that wood kept burning, kept burning, every single piece of wood burned to ashes. He was sitting there with great peace. Nothing happened to him. That is, it was such wood, such a fire, that even a person's bones would burn, but absolutely nothing happened to him. Not even a little bit happened to him. That is, he was really a lover of Ali. He had made mistakes. So now the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, said to him that the Prophet had said about me, "O Ali," and the Prophet had said several times, "O Ali, you are my divider." "O Ali, you are the one who will divide between paradise and hell." This person, this young man, without a single, not even a single scratch on him. But here I will tell you a rider, this does not mean that we should commit sins. This does not mean that. Why? Because one effect of sin is that sin also takes a person out of the Wilayah (Guardianship) of the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them. This one was fortunate that despite such a big sin, there was something that held him back. Anyway, God willing, we will discuss the rest tomorrow.

### The Pinnacle of Love: The Companions of Imam Husayn (`A.S.`)

So this is love, and if anyone has shown the manifestation of this love in the world, it is the companions of Imam Hussain, peace be upon him. When the young men of the Banu Hashim got the news at night, they got the news at night, and that was that Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, said, "Sister Zainab, I have been called to the court."

#### Imam Husayn's Departure from Medina

Lady Zainab got worried that why have I been called to the court so late at night? The court is not held at night. The Imam said that their ruler has passed away. Their, their, their ruler has passed away. And I know why I have been called. And my answer is also very clear. Lady Zainab said, "Brother, if this is the matter, then I will not let you go to the court alone." She turned and said, "Brother Abbas, son Ali Akbar. Look, the master is going to the court. You people go with him."

##### The Night Summon by Walid

It is written in the Maqtal that there were 30 young men of the Banu Hashim who surrounded Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, and took him to the Dar al-Imarah (Governor's Palace). After reaching the Dar al-Imarah, as soon as they got close, Imam Hussain said, "You all wait outside. I will go inside alone. It is not appropriate for you to come. But if my voice is raised, then you should come inside."

###### Lady Zainab's Concern and Abbas's Readiness

Now when the Imam came and sat down, the news of the ruler's death was announced. According to the Islamic law, according to the Islamic rule, the Imam came and recited the Istirja', "Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Him we shall return."

ÿ•ŸêŸÜŸéŸëÿß ŸÑŸêŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸê ŸàŸéÿ•ŸêŸÜŸéŸëÿß ÿ•ŸêŸÑŸéŸäŸíŸáŸê ÿ±Ÿéÿßÿ¨ŸêÿπŸèŸàŸÜŸé
- [Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:156]

(Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Him we shall return.)

###### Imam Husayn's Confrontation with Walid

Walid said, "Now the new ruler who has come, Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah, his order is that you should pledge allegiance to him." The Imam explained that this is a matter of allegiance, it is not decided in the darkness of the night. Tomorrow, in the day, call the Muslims, the matter will be decided in front of everyone, who will pledge allegiance and whose allegiance will be taken. Walid said, "No, but the ruler insists that you pledge allegiance now, at this very moment. You have to pledge allegiance at this very moment, and there is no permission to give any respite." The Imam said, "If you want to hear my decision now, then listen, that:

ŸÖŸêÿ´ŸíŸÑŸêŸä ŸÑŸéÿß ŸäŸèÿ®ŸéÿßŸäŸêÿπŸè ŸÖŸêÿ´ŸíŸÑŸéŸáŸè
- [Reference needed]

(One like me will never pledge allegiance to one like him.)

One like me will never pledge allegiance to one like Yazid."

###### Marwan's Incitement and Imam Husayn's Response

Saying this, Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, got up and started to leave. As soon as he started to leave, Marwan called out, "Walid, Hussain is going. Stop him, otherwise if he gets out of hand today, then again, until rivers of blood flow in Medina, you will not be able to take Hussain's allegiance." As soon as Marwan uttered these sentences, as soon as the accursed Marwan uttered these phrases, the son of Fatimah became furious. He said, "O son of the blue-eyed woman, are you threatening me with death? Who will kill me? Will Walid do it or will you do it?" As Hussain's voice was raised, the young men of the Banu Hashim entered the Dar al-Gharah (House of Plunder). The swords were about to come out of the scabbards. Abbas's voice was raised. It is written in the Maqtal that Hussain put his hand on the hilt of his sword. "Brother Abbas, this is not the time for war. This is not the time for war. Be patient." Abbas was patient. I will say, "Master, oh, how long will Abbas be patient?"

##### The Farewell to Medina

Hussain came back. Now Medina, now he came and said to his sister, "Sister Zainab, now Medina is not a place to live in anymore. Now we will have to leave Medina."

###### Visiting the Grandfather's Grave

Hussain just said this sentence and went to his grandfather's grave. Now this news echoed in Medina that the son of the Prophet is leaving Medina.

###### Umm Salama's Prophetic Vision and the Soil of Karbala

Now when Hussain came back from his grandfather's grave, Umm al-Mu'minin, Lady Umm Salama, came and asked, "Son, what am I hearing? That you are leaving Medina? Where are you going?" He said, "I am going to Iraq." As soon as she heard the name of Iraq, Umm Salama's heart trembled. "Oh son, your grandfather had said something about the soil of Medina." He said, "Yes, grandmother, you have said it right. And what my grandfather said will happen." Umm Salama could not bear it. Hussain consoled her and what did he do? He miraculously lifted the land of Karbala and said, "Grandmother, I will be killed here." He picked up the soil of Karbala and said, "You keep this. As long as this soil is soil, I will be alive. When this soil turns into blood, then understand that your Hussain is not alive." Umm Salama took that soil and kept it next to the soil that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, had given.

###### The Martyrdom on Ashura

And now when Hussain had left Medina, Umm Salama would come again and again and look at that soil. When she saw that it was soil, her heart would be consoled. Once, this time passed, and the afternoon of Ashura came. Umm Salama was sleeping. What did she see in her dream? The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, came, his clothes were dusty, his sleeves were rolled up, he was throwing dust. "O Umm Salama, you are sleeping peacefully? My Hussain..." Umm Salama came. Now when she came and looked, she saw that that soil had now turned into blood. Blood was flowing. Umm Salama slapped her face, mourned, "Oh, Hussain!" Hearing the voice of Umm Salama, the ladies came. "Oh, lady, do not say like this. Our, our master is on a journey. Our Hussain is on a journey." She said, "No, now Hussain is not on a journey. Now Hussain is not in this world." Oh, Hussain, the oppressed.
