### Introduction: The Marsiya of Mir Anees on Janab Aun and Muhammad (AS)

Here are a few verses from a marsiya (elegy) by Mir Anees, from "The Sun Traversed the Distance of the Night," about Janab Aun and Muhammad, which are presented here:

*The master of the high and low had put on his weapons, and the standard of the master of mankind was ready.*
*The ladies of the house were all around with their heads uncovered, the sister of the Imam was weeping, holding the staff of the standard.*
*The sons of Zainab, with swords on their shoulders, stood under the standard. Gathering the hems of their skirts, the flower garden of affection, they stood with dignity.*
*The splendor of Jafar, the awe of the lion of God, was apparent in their small stature.*
*They touched their eyes to the standard and kissed the flag, and began to dance around the banner.*
*Sometimes they would look at their mother, sometimes at the standard, and sometimes they would cry out, "We are sacrificed for the king of the nations!"*
*The two brothers would sometimes consult with each other, and sometimes they would quietly ask their mother, "What is the intention for the standard of Ali, the friend of Allah? Mother, who will receive the standard of our grandfather?"*

*"If the king of kings, of good example, would consult us, we too are worthy, you should keep this in mind."*
*With utmost respect, they said, "We have no right, but we are also afraid that you might be displeased.*
*We are the slaves of the master and are ready to sacrifice our lives. We seek honor and are hopeful for a name."*
*All the young men in the army of the Messenger were peerless, but the Prophet gave the standard to our grandfather.*
*In Khyber, the mighty army watched in amazement, but it was Ali who received the standard at the time of trial.*
*We are not lacking in strength, though we are hungry and thirsty. We are his grandsons, and his descendants.*

Zainab then said, *"What have you to do with this? What right do I have? The Imam is the master and the one with authority.*
*See that you do not say anything inappropriate. I will be angry if you mention the standard. Go, stand aside with your hands folded.*
*Why did you come here, leaving Ali Akbar?"*
*"Move aside, do not stand near the standard, lest the king of the heavens see and I lose my senses.*
*This request is not acceptable. You will start crying if I say anything good or bad. What can I say to you in your childhood except to protect your honor?"*
*"A short life and a desire for a high position. It is good that you have found a way to show your stature.*
*May your mother be sacrificed for you, although this is a proof of your courage. Yes, among your peers, you have no equal.*
*It is necessary to think and reflect on the pros and cons. Why should a man desire what he cannot achieve?"*
*"Will this standard be lifted by these small hands? Your steps are smaller than everyone else's. The qualities of the Prophet are in your every step.*
*This is the position, this is the glory. If you ask for permission, it is my job. May your mother be sacrificed, today there is a name in dying."*
*"Then what of you? The elders are the pride of the age. It is not fitting to be proud of additional qualities.*
*The real jewels are those that are self-evident. Show today the battle of Haider and Jafar.*
*Why should you say that you are the sons of the friend of God? The army itself should cry out that you are the grandsons of Ali."*
*"What was the connection of Jafar Tayyar with the standard? This was also a gift from the Messenger of the heavens.*
*In difficult battles, he was the one who was useful. When he drew his sword, Rome and Syria would tremble.*
*When he was sent, the tree of battle bore fruit. When he stayed, God gave him jewels in return."*
*"When the army was defeated for three days, the Messenger of God gave the standard to Ali.*
*When that lion of God killed Marhab and advanced, the army of the fort fled in disarray.*
*The heavy iron gate was uprooted and fell as if someone had plucked a leaf from a tree."*
*"The son of the remover of difficulties has been surrounded for three days.*
*The garden of my mother is being trampled in the jungle.*
*You did not even ask why I have my hair uncovered.*
*I am being plundered, and you are thinking of a position. You are neither my comforter nor a lover of the Imam.*
*I have realized that you are only seeking a name."*

With folded hands, those two sons said, *"O sister of the Imam, control your anger.*
*By Allah, we have no right to even mention the standard. It will be revealed when we, the faithful slaves, fight.*
*We will rout the armies and then sleep in the treasury of the martyrs. Then you will value us, when we are no more."*
Saying this, when the blessed sons stepped back, the mother's heart was filled with emotion, and she said, *"Control your heart.*
*You are giving me the news of your death, my dears. Wait a moment, let this mourner take your sorrows.*
*Why, my darlings, did my advice seem so bad to you? Children, what did you say that pierced my heart like a dagger?"*

The king of the time came to Zainab and said, *"Sister, did you hear what your two sons said? They are lions among lions, intelligent, brave, and victorious.*
*Zainab, these two rose-bodied boys are unique in their time. To look at, they are young, but their ways are like those of elders.*
*Their expressions and their intentions are different. Have you ever seen such spirited children of nine or ten years old?*
*Why shouldn't success kiss their feet? In whose lap were they raised, and whose milk did they drink?*
*No doubt, they are the heirs of the Commander of the Faithful, but what can I do, their age is young."*
*"Now, whoever you say, I will give the standard of the army to him."*
He said, *"As per the counsel of the king of the heavens."*
He said, *"Ever since the esteemed Zahra passed away, I have considered you as a mother. You are the master, whether it is an elder or a child, whoever you say, this position will be entrusted to him."*
The sister said, *"You should also name someone. To whom is your attention directed, O king of the high and low?*
*After the Quran, your word is final. If you ask me, O king of the heavens, in stature, in dignity, in honor, there is no one equal.*
*There is no one better than the renowned Abbas."*
*"He is a lover, a slave, a long-standing servant, a sacrificer of his life. He is a son, a brother, the adornment of your side, a faithful friend.*
*He is a comforter, obedient, renowned, and famous. He is brave, a reminder of his father, the pride of the age.*
*He is a lion-hearted, brave, and virtuous one. He is peerless among hundreds and thousands."*

With tears in his eyes, the king of the time said, *"Yes, this was also the will of Ali, O sister. Well, you call him, where is that victorious one?"*
Akbar went to his uncle upon hearing this and said, *"The glorious king is waiting for you. Come, my aunt has called for you."*
Abbas came with his hands folded before the king. The king said, *"Go to your sister."*
Zainab came with the standard, and the king of the heavens said, taking the standard, *"Her happiness is what pleases the five holy ones. Here, brother, take the standard, this is a gift from your sister."*
Placing his hand on the standard, the one of dignified as the heavens bowed his head and placed it on his sister's feet with pride.
Zainab, taking his sorrows, said, *"I am sacrificed for you. Abbas, be careful with the earnings of Fatima. If there is a chance of peace today, then let's go tomorrow. Take your brother and leave these calamities."*

### The Core Hadith: True Worship and Ma'rifat (Gnosis)

The noble hadith that has been chosen for these ten majalis, in this hadith, the Master of Martyrs, Imam Husain ibn Ali (AS), says:

من عبد اللہ حق عبادتہ، آتاہ اللہ فوق امانیہ و کفایتہ
*Whoever worships Allah as He deserves to be worshipped, Allah will grant him more than his wishes and suffice him in his needs.*
- [Reference needed]

The Master of Martyrs himself says that this hadith emphasizes the importance of Ma'rifat (Recognition). The condition for receiving Allah's bounties – being granted more than one's desires and sufficiency in needs – is to perform the worship that is the *right* of worship. This true worship is not possible without Ma'rifat. If worship is performed without Ma'rifat, its result will be nothing, its result will be zero. Therefore, Ma'rifat is extremely important. In this context, Ma'rifat refers specifically to the Ma'rifat (Recognition) of the Imam of one's time, and the general station of Imamate itself. It is crucial to recognize the general station of Imamate.

### The Distortion of Imamate After the Holy Prophet (PBUH&HP)

See what happened after the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HP). Everything changed immediately. Everyone reached the stage of "Did you turn back on your heels?" (انقلبتم علی اعقابکم). They turned away. People deviated from the straight path. The result was that the definition of everything also changed.

#### Shift in Definition: Imamate as Government/Monarchy

For example, what became the definition of Imamate? Generally, the definition of Imamate now became: Imamate is for the religion and the world, in succession to the Messenger of Allah. Imamate became the name of government, the leadership of the nation. Slowly, this government kept changing. To give it a religious color, they added "for the religion and the world," "in succession to the Messenger of Allah." So, the successor of the Messenger of Allah was the one who had the government. Now, what became the focus of Imamate? It became the government. The one who has the government is the Imam. Slowly, religion was removed from this definition, and only the world remained. And then, what was left in the end? They started saying, "We are with whoever overcomes." We are with whoever wins. Whoever's government it is, he is the Imam.

#### Consequences: Acceptance of Sinful Rulers Like Yazid

Now, many other things came into this redefined Imamate. It was asserted that whoever becomes the Imam, even if he is a sinner, it is acceptable. If he is a transgressor, it is acceptable. Whatever he does, it is acceptable. No problem. Just that he should not be outside of Islam, not outside of the religion. If he is ignorant, it is acceptable. No problem. If an ignorant person becomes the Imam, there is no problem. What should he do? He should just take the help of a scholar so that the scholar can give a fatwa (religious decree). In this way, the definition of Imamate kept changing, and in the end, it was found that there was no real Imamate left, only government remained, which is also called monarchy. Just that a person becomes a master and a king and a ruler, that's all. Then whether the religion remains or not.

#### Fabrication of Hadith to Legitimize Corrupt Rulers

That is why you see in the history of Islam – or rather, it should not be called the history of Islam, but the history of Muslims – it is not a very old matter. If you just go back a little, you will see that it has not even been 40 or 50 years since the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH&HP), barely 50 years have passed, that who has been made the caliph? The Caliph of the Muslims, the Caliph of the Messenger of Allah, who has been made? Yazid ibn Mu'awiya, may Allah's curse be upon him. He was made the caliph, and it was said that he is the caliph of the Messenger of Allah, the successor of the Messenger of Allah. It was done. Now, who was this Yazid? You know, he was a drinker of wine, he used to play with monkeys and dogs. He was the one who could not distinguish between marriage and fornication, meaning what is lawful and what is unlawful; he had no distinction. He knew nothing about it. He was just a debauchee and a profligate. He had nothing to do with the world. Now, what was done for him? Hadiths were fabricated and brought forward that the Prophet had prophesied that he is among the people of Paradise because he had joined the army. All the hadiths were fabricated in his favor so that he could be shown to be a person of Paradise in some way. This was the whole effort. But what is in history, no one can deny that. The reality, no one can deny that. All these things were found in him. Now, if nothing else could be done, they started saying that he looked very handsome. Does Imamate have anything to do with this? He was a very good poet. Does Imamate have anything to do with this? If this is Imamate, then we should search for the Imam who is the most handsome, who is the greatest poet, and make him the Imam. But all these things were created only to hide the real Imamate from the people.

### The Ahlul Bayt's (AS) True Definition of Imamate

But where this was happening on one side, on the other side, the Ahlul Bayt (AS) were continuing their work of guiding the people. The Ahlul Bayt (AS) did not back down from their responsibility. Now you see, the Ahlul Bayt (AS) are defining the Imam and what Imamate is. You see the difference between the two, how much there is. There, it was government and monarchy that became Imamate. Now, here, what does Imam Reza (AS) say about the definition of Imamate? Listen to that.

#### Imamate as the Growing Foundation and High Branch of Islam

Imam Reza (AS) says:

ان الامامۃ اس الاسلام النامی
*Indeed, Imamate is the foundation of Islam. The growing foundation of Islam.*
- [Reference needed]

The word "nami" comes from "numu," which means to grow. That which grows is called "nami." That is, through Imamate, Islam grows and becomes big. If there is no Imamate, then growth will not be found in Islam. See, "numu" means growth. That in which growth is not found is called dead. If there is no real Imamate in Islam, then this Islam will be dead. It will not be a living Islam. And that is what happened in history. The Imam says that this Imamate is the foundation of the religion of Islam, and this is the growing foundation.

He further says: "And it is the high branch of Islam." And this Imamate is the branch of Islam that is very high. That is, among the branches of the religion of Islam – prayer, fasting, Hajj, Zakat, Khums, Jihad, and all other things – what is the highest among the secondary matters of religion? The highest and most important is Imamate. How? That if Imamate is not understood, if you do not follow the correct Imam, the correct Imam who is appointed by Allah and whom the Messenger of Allah has introduced, then neither will prayer be understood, nor fasting, nor Hajj, nor Khums, nor Jihad, nothing will be understood. And that is why you see that because this thing was not present in Islam, people did not follow the correct Imam, that is why there were so many changes in Islam, so many changes came that now the real Islam that was in the time of the Messenger of Allah, that Islam did not remain. If this was the real Islam, then there would not have been so many sects among the Muslims. The division of Muslims into so many sects, as I mentioned in the hadith, that the Prophet (PBUH&HP) said that after me there will be 73 sects. The Jews had 71 sects, the Christians had 72 sects, and the Muslims had 73 sects. So why were all these sects formed? The reason was that they left the real Imam. When they left the real Imam, everyone went their own way. Now, everyone is introducing things according to their own understanding. Everyone is talking according to their own understanding. Different prayers, different fasts, different everything, different Hajj. There are great details about this, but this is not the topic now.

#### Imamate's Position in Principles and Branches of Religion

But you see, that is why it is found in the narration that the Imam says that Islam is based on five things. Islam is built on five things: prayer, Zakat, Hajj, and Wilayat (Guardianship). Here, when the Imam is introducing Islam, he is doing it from the perspective of the branches of the religion, not from the perspective of the principles of the religion. See, Wilayat (Guardianship) and Imamate are things that are in both the Usul al-Din (Principles of Religion) and the Furu al-Din (Branches of Religion). And this is a very important thing, remember that. That is, Imamate and Wilayat are in the principles of the religion because through the Imam, the correct monotheism is known; through the Imam, the correct justice is known; through the Imam, the correct prophethood is known; through the Imam, the correct Imamate is known; and through the Imam, the correct resurrection is known, provided that people follow the correct Imam. Subhanallah. If they follow the correct Imam, if they do not follow the correct Imam, then neither will monotheism be correct, nor justice, nor prophethood, nor Imamate, nor the hereafter, nothing will be correct.

And similarly, in the branches of the religion, if there is no correct Imam, then neither will prayer be correct, nor fasting, nor Hajj, nor Khums, nor Zakat, nor Jihad, nothing will be correct. Neither will enjoining the good be correct, nor forbidding the evil, nor *Tawalla* (association with Allah's friends), nor *Tabarra* (dissociation from Allah's enemies), nothing will be. That is why they say in *Tawalla* and *Tabarra*, what do they say in enjoining the good and forbidding the evil? They say that if a sinner and a transgressor, who is a sinner – a drunkard, a gambler – if he also becomes an Imam, then it is not right to remove him. You should just enjoin the good on him. For example, "O Imam, please do not drink wine. O Imam, please do not gamble." This became their definition of Imamate.

### The Role of Companions in Preserving True Islam: The Example of Zurara and Humran

Now, the definition of Imamate that the Ahlul Bayt (AS) have given, what is that? The Imam says that the foundation of Islam is on five things: prayer, fasting, Hajj, and Zakat, and the fifth thing is Wilayat. So now, Zurara, Zurara is one of the very special companions of the Imam. Zurara ibn A'yan. See, the recognition of the companions is that because of them, the correct Islam, the correct Shia faith, has reached us today. And these are not our words, these are the words of the Imams themselves. The Imam says that if these four companions were not there, then the signs of prophethood would have been lost. If these four companions were not there, and one of them is Zurara, Muhammad ibn Muslim, Burayd al-Ijli, and Abu Basir, if these four companions were not there, the signs of prophethood would have been finished. Or the signs of prophethood reached us through whom? Through these people.

#### Umm al-Aswad: A Catalyst for Change

And Zurara especially, see, he is strange and wonderful. Zurara had several brothers, many brothers, six or seven brothers. And among them, none of them were Shia. You know, none of them were Shia at first. Their sister was Umm al-Aswad. This sister, Umm al-Aswad, see how important a role women have in Islam. If a woman wants, she can change the whole family. Umm al-Aswad had such a big role that Umm al-Aswad made the whole family Shia. Not just Shia, but how, I will tell you that too. This Umm al-Aswad used to go to the lessons of Abu Khalid al-Kabuli. Abu Khalid al-Kabuli was a student of Imam Zain al-Abidin (AS). This Abu Khalid was a companion of the Imam, a companion of the fourth Imam. He was from Kabul, Afghanistan. And he used to regularly attend the Imam's lessons. He was one of the great students, very great. Inshallah, if I get time, I will tell you his stories. His stories are very great, Abu Khalid's. So this Abu Khalid regularly, now what did he do? He started teaching what he learned from the Imam. That was also a very brave thing to do, because the situation at that time was very bad. But Abu Khalid, after all, was a Pathan, he was not afraid of anyone, so he used to teach. He was brave, courageous, he used to teach.

Now, in this lesson, this Umm al-Aswad used to come. When she started coming to the lesson, she automatically started saying, "Man, this is the truth." And she became a Shia, a *mustabsira* (one who gains insight). Allah gave her insight, and she became a Shia. Now, when she became a Shia, she came home and told her brothers, especially Zurara. She told Zurara, "Zurara, come and see what that man says." Because Zurara was previously a Jahmi. Jahmiyya was a sect, Jahmiyya was a sect, a sect among the Muslims, Zurara used to follow it. So Zurara said, "No, no, I will not go there." The sister insisted, "Just come and see." When she insisted, he went. When he went for a short while and asked Abu Khalid al-Kabuli some questions, Zurara became a Shia. When Zurara became a Shia, his brother Humran became a Shia. When Humran became a Shia, then Ubaydullah became a Shia. When Ubaydullah became a Shia, then Bukayr became a Shia. One after another, the brothers became Shia.

#### The Elevated Status of Zurara and Humran

Among them, six brothers turned out to be jurists. How jurists? You think, what a status, that it is found in the hadith that when on the Day of Judgment, a call will be made, "Where are the disciples of Imam Baqir (AS) and Imam Sadiq (AS)?" The disciples, meaning the very special friends. So among them, the first two names are of Zurara and Humran, the two brothers. Now see the status, what it is. And about Humran, the Imam said, "The standard is Humran." If you want to see your belief as correct, then present your belief before Humran. If your belief is like the belief of Humran, then you are a correct Shia. If not, then you are not a correct Shia. What a status! Shaykh Saduq has brought a whole chapter in Ma'ani al-Akhbar, on page 212, "The Standard of Humran." Shaykh Saduq has named the chapter this, "The Chapter of the Standard of Humran." "Tar" means standard. This Shaykh Saduq has brought a whole chapter, you see. And in it, he says that Humran is the standard, the standard of the religion, of the belief. The Imam said, "Before Humran." And all this happened because of whom? Because of a woman. And that is why, in brackets, I will tell you one thing, that if you want to understand Karbala in its reality, in its truth, then you must understand the role of women in Karbala. You must understand its importance. Read it, you will see what role women played in Karbala and how Karbala remained alive because of them. I will not go into details now, this is just in brackets.

#### The Superiority of Wilayat

So you see, now Zurara asked the Imam, "Now that you are telling us that these five things are the foundation of the religion, which of them is the best, the most excellent?" The Imam replied, "Wilayat is the most excellent." Wilayat is more excellent than what? Than prayer. Than what? Than fasting, Hajj. Imamate and Wilayat are more excellent than all these things. Now you will not ask, will you, brother, what is more important? Wow, wow, wow. Recite a Salawat on Muhammad and the family of Muhammad. But still, there are some people among us who ask questions even after this. "No, no, this does not mean this, it means that." Zurara is asking a very clear question, "What is the most excellent?" The Imam said, "The most excellent." The Imam also gives a reason for this, he gives a reason, why? "Because Wilayat is the key." Wilayat is the key, the key to all these acts of worship. All acts of worship are known through Imamate. "And the guide to them." The Imam guides, the Imam guides on how to perform these acts of worship correctly.

See, we keep reading one hadith again and again, so that the point is clear for everyone. A companion of Imam Sadiq (AS) came and asked the Imam, "What is the similarity and what is the difference between us and our opponents?" The question was a very simple question. "What is the similarity and what is the difference between us and other Muslims?" The Imam replied that there is no similarity except that we only face the same qibla, that's all. Facing the Kaaba. Other than that, there is nothing. What is the reason? The reason is very simple. Monotheism was changed. Justice was removed from the principles of the religion. If we talk about prophethood, that is a whole separate chapter. That is, how did they present the Prophet? Just one example, if I give it, the matter will become clear to you. In the beginning of prophethood, how did they define the Messenger of Allah? Gabriel came with revelation. The Messenger of Allah got scared seeing Gabriel, he started running here and there. Gabriel said, "Don't be scared, I am a messenger, I am the messenger of Allah." The Messenger of Allah did not understand. The Messenger of Allah came back home, covered himself with a blanket, and started shivering. He got a fever. Lady Khadija (SA) asked, "What happened?" "I don't know, I saw something in the cave of Hira." "Let's go to my cousin, Waraqa ibn Nawfal." They went to Waraqa ibn Nawfal. Who was Waraqa? Was Waraqa a Muslim? No, at that time there was no Islam, so how could Waraqa be a Muslim? They took him to Waraqa. Waraqa looked at him, who was Waraqa, you know, he was an astrologer. An astrologer, you know, an astrologer. He looked at him and said, "Oh, he has become a prophet." He is seeing that he has become a prophet. Now he has become a prophet. So if Waraqa understood prophethood better, then he is better suited to become a prophet than the Messenger of Allah himself. You saw how they introduced prophethood. This is one example, there are hundreds of such examples, hundreds of examples.

### The Ahlul Bayt (AS) as the Root of All Good and Evil

So the Imam says, that is why you see, another hadith I will present to you, and this hadith is very important. This is very important. Make it a principle of your life. This narration is from Imam Sadiq (AS).

#### Good Deeds Emanating from Ahlul Bayt

The Imam says, "We are the root of all good." We are the root of every good, the root of every good. "And from our branches is every good deed." All the good deeds are our branches, the branches of Imamate. And from our branches is what? "Monotheism." Among the good deeds is monotheism, that is, correct monotheism, prayer, fasting, ethics, that is, controlling anger, forgiving the sins of sinners, having mercy on the poor, taking care of neighbors, and acknowledging the virtue of those who are virtuous, those who are truly virtuous, acknowledging them. That is, whatever good you can imagine, whether it is in the principles of the religion, or in the branches of the religion, or in ethics, in everything, whatever good there is, its root is the Ahlul Bayt (AS).

#### Evil Deeds Emanating from Their Enemies

After that, the Imam says, "And our enemies are the root of all evil." Whatever evil you see, its root is our enemies. "And all the evil and indecencies." All the evil and indecencies emanate from our enemies. And among them is what? He says, "Lying, miserliness, backbiting, breaking ties of kinship," that is, cutting off relations with relatives, "and consuming interest," consuming usury, "consuming the wealth of orphans," consuming the wealth of orphans unjustly.

#### The Prohibition of Consuming Orphan's Wealth and Imam's Share

It is forbidden to consume the wealth of orphans unjustly. The Imam says in the explanation of this verse, what is the verse?

إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَأْكُلُونَ أَمْوَالَ الْيَتَامَىٰ ظُلْمًا إِنَّمَا يَأْكُلُونَ فِي بُطُونِهِمْ نَارًا ۖ وَسَيَصْلَوْنَ سَعِيرًا
*Those who consume the wealth of orphans unjustly.*
*They are only taking fire into their bellies, and soon they will be thrown into that fire.*
- [Reference needed]

This is a verse of the Quran. "Those who consume the wealth of orphans unjustly," that is, unjustly, meaning they have no right to eat it. That is, if they have a right, he explains it now, a little, if they have a right, but we will tell you how. Why? Because the Imam of the time himself says in this *Tawqi'* (letter from the Imam), may Allah hasten his noble reappearance, in the explanation of this noble verse, the Imam says, "Whoever consumes even a little of our wealth, then what is he doing? He is taking fire into his belly, and soon he will be thrown into the fire." The Imam says, "Our wealth." What is the wealth of the Imam? It is the share of the Imam. It is the share of the Imam. Now, what is the right in it? The right is for the one who is distributing the share of the Imam, distributing it, distributing the share of the Imam. He is delivering the share of the Imam to the people, collecting it, coming and going, he is doing all that. So the effort he is making and the time he is giving, he can take the wage for that much effort and that much time. He can take that much, that I can take this much. And if someone is doing that work full-time, full-time, then how much right does he have to take? What is in the narrations, which the jurists have also stated, is that he can take as much as is sufficient to run a middle-class family today. He can take that much money, not more than that. Now, the rest, you can ask the jurists, the scholars, the *maraji'* (religious authorities), what is its further explanation and interpretation. We do not know more than what we have read in the hadiths and the fatwas of the jurists. We are telling you from there. You can check it, read it with satisfaction. And if you want more details, then you should ask the jurists and the *maraji'*, they will tell you more details about it. So, consuming the wealth of an orphan is a very bad thing, a very bad thing.

#### The Broad Definition of Sin and Parental Responsibility

And after that, what is there? "And sinning." Sinning means to cross the limits of Allah. This is taken from the second verse of Surah Talaq. In Surah Talaq, Allah says:

وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ
*Whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, he has wronged himself.*
- [Surah Talaq, 65:2]

He has sinned, he has committed a forbidden act. Well, this sin can be in both ways. Doing something is a sin, and not doing something is also a sin. For example, if drinking wine is a sin, then if someone does it, it is a sin. Okay, not doing something is also a sin. For example, if a young person does not pray, then this is a sin. This is abandoning an obligation, which is forbidden. This is a sin, a sin. He will be punished for it. Allah will punish him for it.

See, we usually do not wake up the children in the morning, saying that he is sleeping, he must be tired. We have to wake them up. That is why we let them sleep, we do not say anything. He is sleeping, he is sleeping. Well, we also said that, well, that was in another majlis, not here, that the one who is young, he feels more sleepy, especially the young children, that is why there is a saying in English, "sleep like a baby." The younger a person is in age, the better he sleeps. That is why they do not study in the morning, most of them, very few, rare, who are punctual in the morning. We are talking about children, we are talking about young people. So what do we do? "Oh, he is sleeping now, let him sleep. Don't disturb him, he is sleeping. He was tired, he was studying at night." We just ask you one question. If, God forbid, may Allah not will it, if there is a fire in your house, and it is in the same room where that child is sleeping, will you say, "He is tired, let him sleep"? Will you say, "Let him sleep"? No, the first thing your attention will go to is him, how to save him and bring him out. He should be saved, even if we get burned, it is okay, but our child should be saved. So this is that fire that is not going to burn much, and there is a possibility that he will be saved anyway, the fire may even be extinguished. We are so worried about that. So you think, that fire that will be an eternal fire, that will never be, but about which the Quran says:

فَاتَّقُوا النَّارَ الَّتِي وَقُودُهَا النَّاسُ وَالْحِجَارَةُ
*Fear that fire whose fuel is men and stones.*
- [Reference needed]

Man is its fuel, the fuel of that fire is man, the Quran is saying. We are leaving it, and we are not even admonishing the children. We ourselves do not care, and we do not admonish the children either. We do not explain to the children either. Let them do it, let them do it. No, you see the emphasis in the hadith, it is emphasized that when a child becomes seven years old, you should command him to pray. Seven years old. This is in the hadith. And if someone says that he is not yet an adult, no, he is not an adult, that is a different matter of puberty at 15 years old. Here, we are talking about training. When a child is seven years old, you should command him, and when he is 10 years old, and if he does not pray, then you should hit him. Of course, hitting does not mean a lot, but with a stick, to break him, so that he starts hating the religion. No, no, not like that. It means a light touch, so that he knows that yes, his parents consider it important. So, just as it is very important, so is fasting, so are other acts of worship, Hajj. We ignore Hajj very easily. Even those who are able to, do not go for Hajj. Hajj is obligatory. And in the narrations, if someone who is able to perform Hajj, but does not do it, then if he dies, he will die the death of a Jew or a Christian, but he will not die a Muslim. This is in the narrations. And there is so much emphasis, of course, this is the first level of ability, but if you go a little deeper, then the Imams (AS) emphasize it so much, they emphasize it so much, they say that even if you have to take a loan to go, then go. Even if you have to take a loan, why? You are performing a very important act of worship. So the Imam here says that a person should avoid sins.

After that, he says, "And avoid indecencies." And avoid indecencies, that is, bad deeds, dirty deeds, whether they are apparent or hidden, or apparently or secretly, whatever it is. "And fornication, and theft, and every evil." And every thing that is considered bad in Islam and is called bad, avoid it. You are told to stay away from it. After that, now when the Imam has divided both things, what is good and what is evil, after that, the Imam says a sentence, he says, "So he lies, that man who claims or thinks, he thinks that he is from us, our lover, our Shia, but his actions are like those of our enemies. He commits forbidden acts, sins, and claims that we are the lovers of the Ahlul Bayt. What kind of lover is he? He cannot be a lover." So the Imam says, and similarly, there is another hadith similar to this, that is, in the context of this verse, the Imam says that Allah has forbidden all indecencies, that is, indecent things, Allah has forbidden them. So what is apparent from it? The bad deeds that happen. And what is hidden? The enemies of the Ahlul Bayt. Allah has forbidden even getting close to the enemies of the Ahlul Bayt, getting close to them, the enemies of the Ahlul Bayt, yes, that even, that is, those who have usurped the right of the Ahlul Bayt, listening to their words. Anyway, there are details on this, Inshallah, we will present them to you some other time. Now, that is why, see, what is Imamate? Islam, the perfection of Islam, Islam becomes capable through Imamate.

### Maytham al-Tammar (AS): A Paragon of Wilayat and Foreknowledge

That is, before moving forward, we will present to you, we will mention to you a man who was completely immersed in the love of Ali (AS) and the Wilayat (Guardianship) of Ali (AS), completely immersed in Wilayat. And who was he? He was Janab Maytham al-Nahrawani, who is also called Maytham al-Tammar. What was his real name? Maytham al-Nahrawani, because he was from Nahrawan, an Iraqi. And al-Tammar because he used to sell dates, he had a date stall, that is why he was also called al-Tammar.

#### Ali's (AS) Prophecy to Maytham

They say, Maytham says that one day, the Commander of the Faithful (AS) called me and said to me, "O Maytham, what will be your condition when the wicked one of the Banu Umayya," the Imam used a special word for him, we are using a very mild word, "the wicked one of the Banu Umayya, Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, will say to you, 'Curse Ali, speak ill of Ali.'" Maytham said, "O Commander of the Faithful, by God, I can never do this, I will never do it." The Master of the Universe then asked a second question, "Do you know the outcome? Do you know?" He said, "What will happen, O Master?" He said, "They will kill you and they will also crucify you." Listen to Maytham's answer, what a beautiful answer it is. He said, "I will bear this little trouble." I will bear this little trouble. The Master says, "Then if you bear this, then you will be with me in Paradise." You will be with me in Paradise.

#### Maytham's Foreknowledge and Preparations

Now, after this, what is there? "And Maytham used to go to the leader of his people," the leader is called "arif," he used to go to him and say, "O so-and-so, I see you." Now see, he is repeating the same thing that we discussed that day, whose was it? It was Rashid al-Hajari. Now, the Master told Maytham this much, but now see at what level he was, that he says, "I see that the wicked one of the Banu Umayya is calling you, and he says to me and to you, 'Bring Maytham to me.' And you take me to that wicked one, and that wicked one of the Banu Umayya crucifies me on the gallows." After that, Maytham went to Amr ibn Hurayth, and he says to Amr ibn Hurayth, "Very soon I will be killed, and I will be your neighbor." So Amr says, "I wish it were so." Then Maytham goes to that tree, because what did the Master say? "You will be crucified on the date palm tree outside the house of Amr ibn Hurayth." He will be crucified on it. Now, Maytham repeatedly passes by that tree and waters it, so that the tree does not dry up. You see the belief, Maytham is watering it.

#### Confrontation with Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad

Now, what happened? That time came. That time came when Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, may Allah's curse be upon him, this wicked one, became the ruler of Kufa, and he summoned Maytham. And he first summoned that *arif*, the leader of the tribe, and said, "I want Maytham." He said, "Maytham has gone to Mecca." He said, "Summon him, summon him somehow." So he sent a message to Maytham. Maytham came. He went a long way to meet Maytham, and he brought Maytham and stood him before Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, may his curse be upon him, saying, "This is Maytham." Now, after this, a detailed conversation took place between Maytham and Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad. In short, quickly, I will tell you. He asked, "Are you Maytham?" Maytham said very proudly, "Yes, I am Maytham." See, some people nowadays speak a little too much Arabic, so they pronounce it "Meesam." "Meesam" is the wrong pronunciation. Yes, "Maytham" is the correct pronunciation. The correct pronunciation is "Maytham." But they start saying "Maytam, Maytam." It is not "Maytham," it is "Maytham." "Maytham" means "we were," as it is read in Arabic. "Maytham" is not, in fact, it was originally a Persian word that was Arabized.

So he said, "Are you Maytham?" He said, "Yes, I am Maytham." He said, "Curse Abu Turab." Curse Abu Turab. Maytham said, "Who is Abu Turab? I do not know any Abu Turab." So he said, "You do not know Abu Turab? Curse Ali ibn Abi Talib." Maytham said, "If I do not, then I will kill you." Maytham said, "My Master used to say this, that 'Maytham, you will be killed, and you will be crucified on the tree outside the house of Amr ibn Hurayth, and after being crucified for three days, on the fourth day, blood will start flowing from your nose,' meaning your death will come. For three days, you will remain crucified like this, and on the fourth day, you will die." Allahu Akbar. Do you understand what it means to be crucified for three days? To remain crucified for three days. You just stand like this for a short while, and if a person is just hung like this, in a short while, a person will get tired, he will become distressed. We are talking about a short while, maximum half an hour, one hour, two hours, a person cannot hang like this. If both hands are tied, here Maytham is hanging for three days. On the fourth day, blood started flowing from his nose. Ibn Ziyad, the cursed one, said that the same should be done to him.

#### The Tying of Maytham's Mouth: A Prelude to Karbala

After that, when Maytham was being taken away, what did Maytham say? "O people of Kufa!" See this sentence that I was presenting to you. Those who are immersed in the love of Ali, see their status, see their position, what it is. "O people of Kufa, with me now," that is, "I will be killed." This will happen, whatever it is, he gave the details. In short, "If you want to know something about the future, then ask me, I will tell you." I will tell you, that is, he called, he invited, whatever it is, all the tribulations that are to happen until the Day of Judgment, Maytham says, "I can tell you about all of them." When a lover of Ali has such knowledge, then what can you say about the Ahlul Bayt? And then people started asking questions. So you know what he did to Maytham? He, Ibn Ziyad, ordered that the thick ropes, with those ropes, Maytham's mouth should be tied so that he cannot speak. The thick ropes, that is, there is a special word for it in Arabic, with those ropes, it should be tied. So Maytham's whole mouth was tied with those ropes, and then Maytham was crucified. And it is written in the hadith that he was the first person in Islam, Maytham was the first person whose mouth was tied with ropes like this. After that, it became a common practice of the Banu Umayya, and after the Banu Umayya, the Banu Marwan did this, that whoever spoke too much, his mouth was tied with those ropes. And after the Banu Marwan, the Banu Abbas also started it, and all these rulers of the golden period of Islam, they all did this, which they call the golden period. This is their golden period. So Maytham's mouth was tied with thick ropes in this way, it is very hard, a person's life would leave him at that very moment. This was the prelude to Karbala. This was the prelude. Maytham was telling what was going to happen. And this same Ibn Ziyad, see, the Ahlul Bayt (AS) do not do anything deceitfully. Whatever the Ahlul Bayt (AS) do, they do it openly. Even Janab Muslim had the opportunity to kill Ibn Ziyad in the house of Hani ibn Urwah, in the house of Hani ibn Hadi ibn Urwah, there was an opportunity to kill him, but he did not kill him, because the Ahlul Bayt (AS) do not do anything deceitfully. Remember this principle of the Ahlul Bayt (AS). But anyway, then what he did to Muslim, you know that.

### The Sacrifice of Aun and Muhammad (AS) in Karbala

And the same happened in Karbala. Then on the day of Ashura, one by one, everyone was martyred. The series of martyrdoms began in the morning. Until, when among the Banu Hashim, the children of Aqil had given their martyrdom, then it was the turn of the children of Abdullah ibn Jafar.

#### Zainab's (SA) Initiative

When it was the turn of the children of Abdullah ibn Jafar, Janab Zainab (SA) said to her sons, "Go, my sons, go and get permission from your uncle and go and be martyred. Go and be sacrificed for your uncle." Janab Zainab (SA) was admonishing her children, "Go, my son, go." The children said, "Mother, you go yourself, you get permission from our uncle." Zainab took the hands of both her children, Aun and Muhammad, and brought them and stood silently before Husain (AS). Now, who would know Zainab better than Husain? He asked, "Sister Zainab, why have you come?" She said, "Brother, you know why I have come, and I know that you will not refuse my request. Brother, now give permission to these children. Now the children of Muslim have also been martyred. Now let my children be martyred. Now let them be sacrificed." Husain (AS) gave permission.

#### Zainab's Instructions and Their Heroism

It is written in the *maqtal* (book of martyrdom) that Zainab took both her children to the tent and Zainab herself prepared them. And while preparing them, Zainab was explaining, "Look, my sons, you are going, you are going for sacrifice, you are going to fight, but be very careful about two things. Be very careful about two things. One, that you should fight in such a way that people themselves say that these are the grandsons of Jafar Tayyar and the grandsons of Haider Karrar." As Mir Anees says, "Why should you say that you are the sons of the friend of God? The armies should cry out that you are the grandsons of Ali." She admonished them well, she explained well. She said, "Son, look, the second thing is that I know that you have been hungry and thirsty for three days, but do not turn towards the water, because the children in the tent are thirsty. Ali Asghar is thirsty, Sakina is thirsty, everyone in the tent is thirsty. Do not even think about water."

Now listen to the sentences of the *maqtal*, I hand them over to you. And it is written in the *maqtal* that one brother attacked the right flank, the other brother attacked the left flank. One brother sent some horsemen to hell, and some who were on foot, he sent them to hell. The other brother also sent horsemen and foot soldiers to hell in the same way. When both brothers were attacking the right and left flanks like this, then Ibn Umar ibn Sa'd said, "Hey, surround them and kill them. These are the children of Banu Hashim, not the children of the nobles and merchants of Kufa. Surround them and kill them." So they were surrounded and attacked. When the attack happened, first one brother fell from the horse, then the other brother fell from the horse. They called out, "Uncle, farewell." Husain (AS) went, taking his strong arm, Abbas (AS), with him. When they reached the battlefield, both children had departed from this world. Husain (AS) picked up the body of one, and Abbas (AS) picked up the body of the other. They brought them and placed them in the tent.

#### Zainab's Unmatched Patience and Grief

And when the bodies were placed in the tent, that lady came and said, "My lady, come, see, the princes have come." When Zainab was on her prayer mat, she said, "I did not tell them to come back, so why did they come back?" Fizza, with folded hands of respect, said, "My lady, at least see in what condition they have come."

##### Zainab's Prostration of Gratitude

Now, when Zainab came and saw that scene, the scene that may Allah not show to any mother, on one side was the body of Aun, on the other side was the body of Muhammad. Zainab performed a prostration of gratitude, "O Lord, accept my small sacrifice." It is not found anywhere that Zainab mourned for Aun and Muhammad. Whenever Zainab mourned, she mourned for Husain (AS), she mourned for the family of Husain (AS). The eleventh of Muharram came, Zainab did not mourn for Aun and Muhammad. She reached Kufa, she did not mourn for Aun and Muhammad. She went from Kufa to Sham, she did not mourn for Aun and Muhammad. She came from Sham to Karbala, she did not mourn for Aun and Muhammad.

##### Zainab's Return to Medina and Final Grief

Then when she came from Karbala to Medina, Zainab was sitting outside her house. Zainab had become old from all the hardships of Karbala. Abdullah ibn Jafar did not recognize her. He said, "My lady, why are you sitting outside like this? Why are you sitting outside? Go to your house." Zainab once removed the veil from her face, "O Abdullah, you also did not recognize me?" Abdullah, seeing Zainab's condition, screamed and started crying. He took Zainab's arm and brought her into the house. Until now, Zainab was being patient. Now, until now, Zainab was being patient. Once, as soon as Zainab came into the house, when she saw the small beds of both Aun and Muhammad, the mother's heart broke. The memory of her children came back. "O Aun, O Muhammad, O Husain."
