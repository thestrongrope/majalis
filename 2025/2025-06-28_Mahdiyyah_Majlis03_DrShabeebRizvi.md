### Poetic Recitation and Supplication

(The lecture began with a poignant recitation, likely a form of elegiac poetry or supplication, setting a solemn tone.)

O those who are going, when you go to the door of Abbas, narrate this petition to my master.
O those who are going, when you go to the door of Abbas, narrate this petition to my master.
First, say to them, "Listen to me," then say, "A servant of yours is suffering in his homeland."
Then say, "A servant of yours is suffering in his homeland. He has brought nothing but the desire for pilgrimage."
O Ali, narrate this to my master. Those who are going, when you go to the door of Abbas, O Ali, narrate this to my master.
I know that one does not go to Karbala with money. When you call, the provisions for the journey are arranged themselves.
When you call, the provisions for the journey are arranged themselves. If it is written, if it is written, then not a single moment is wasted.
O Ali, narrate this to my master.

Do not weep yet, sister Zainab. Do not weep yet, sister Zainab.
Your brother's shadow is still over your head. Do not weep yet, sister Zainab.

The liver has not yet been brought out, O lady. For now, Zainab, look your fill at Akbar's chest. Do not weep yet, sister Zainab.

The thought of your veil makes my heart tremble. Even after death, I will have to bear this sorrow.
The blood on the point of the spear will make me weep with this grief. Do not weep yet, sister Zainab.
Sister, look, the arms of Abbas are still intact. Do not shed tears for the sake of Ali's honor.
If Abbas goes to the river and does not return, then weep. Do not weep yet, sister Zainab.
I place Sakina's hands in your hands. This is my only request to you, my beloved sister.
If she sees you weeping, the innocent one will also weep. Do not weep yet, sister Zainab. Do not weep yet, sister Zainab.

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ (O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad).

### Introduction: The Essence of Worship and Divine Promise

The master of martyrs, Imam al-Husayn ibn Ali (peace be upon them), states in a noble Hadith:

مَن اللهُ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِه، آتَاهُ اللهُ فَوْقَ مُنَاهُ وَ حَاجَتِه.
"Whoever worships Allah as He deserves to be worshipped, Allah will grant him more than his wishes and his needs."
- [Reference needed]

This means that if one worships Allah in the manner He deserves, fulfilling the true right of worship, Allah will bestow upon them more than they can imagine or conceive. The previous discussion revolved around the concept of Imamate (Divine Leadership), and it is incumbent upon every Shia, indeed, upon every human being, to seek and understand the truth using their intellect. This intellect is a great blessing from Allah. It is observed that as a person's status, virtue, and rank increase in the sight of Allah, Allah blesses them with special favors that He does not bestow upon others.

### The Status of a Lover of the Ahl al-Bayt (Wilayat)

To illustrate the lofty status and position of a lover of the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them) in the sight of Allah, consider the following tradition.

#### The Narration of Sudayr al-Sayrafi

There is a very famous and well-known narration involving Sudayr al-Sayrafi, a distinguished companion of the Sixth Imam, Imam Sadiq (peace and blessings be upon him). Sudayr was a great lover of the Ahl al-Bayt and is considered reliable (thiqa) in the books of Rijal (biographical evaluation). He narrates that he and some other companions were present in the service of Imam Sadiq (peace be upon him) when the Imam turned to him and addressed him:

"O Sudayr! Our lover worships Allah while standing, sitting, sleeping, alive, and dead. In every state, he worships Allah: standing, sitting, sleeping, alive, and dead."
- [Reference needed]

When Sudayr heard this, despite being a great companion, the Imam's statement was profound and difficult for him to fully comprehend immediately. So he humbly asked, "May my life be sacrificed for you! His worship while standing, sitting, and alive is understandable. But how can he worship while sleeping and in a dead state, meaning after he has died?" It is commonly understood that the Talqin (instruction) of beliefs is recited after death because beliefs can still be affirmed, but actions cannot be performed. Yet, here the Imam states that even in sleep and after death, the worship of "our lover" continues. Sudayr expressed his difficulty in understanding this.

#### Worship While Sleeping: Angelic Intercession

The Imam (peace be upon him) then explained: "When our lover lies down and goes to sleep, as soon as the time for prayer comes, Allah appoints two angels. These angels, whom Allah has created on the earth, have never ascended to the heavens, and the inhabitants of the heavens have never seen them. So these two angels, on his behalf, in his stead, begin to pray. They continue to pray for him until he wakes up, and the reward of their prayer is credited to his account. Why? Because he loves the Ahl al-Bayt. He is a lover of the Ahl al-Bayt."
- [Reference needed]

This phenomenon is similar to the incident narrated yesterday, where the wood burned, but the lover of the Ahl al-Bayt did not burn. Here, a person is sleeping, yet angels are praying on his behalf, and the reward is being written in his name. The narration explicitly states: "The reward of their prayer, Allah will write in the account of that believer." And the nature of this prayer is extraordinary: "One rak'ah of the prayer of these angels is equal to a thousand rak'ahs of the prayer of men." Such immense reward is granted simply because the heart is overflowing with the love of the progeny of Muhammad, full of the passion for "Ya Ali."

#### Worship After Death: Perpetual Blessings in the Grave

The Imam (peace be upon him) continued, addressing the state after death: "And when our lover dies, these two angels ascend to the heavens. They present themselves in the court of Allah and say, 'O Lord, this servant of Yours, who was a Shia, has now died. His death has come, and You know better than us that he has died, the matter is over. So now give us permission to remain in the heavens and worship only You.'"
- [Reference needed]

Allah commands them: "I do not need your worship. Go to the grave of that believer and continuously, until the Day of Judgment, keep praying at his grave, the reward of which will continue to be given to him." This prayer at the grave will be of the same magnitude: one rak'ah of their prayer is equal to a thousand rak'ahs of human prayer.
- [Reference needed]

The angels, perplexed, ask: "O our Lord, who is this fortunate one? Who is this lucky one who has received so much of Your love? Your love, meaning You love him so much. Who is this lucky one?"
- [Reference needed]

Allah answers, revealing to the angels: "This is the one who made a covenant with My servant Muhammad and his successor, meaning the Commander of the Faithful (Ali), and after that, with his progeny, the eleven Imams; he made a covenant of their guardianship (Wilayat), that he will accept their guardianship, he will follow their guardianship. So continue to pray until I resurrect him on the Day of Judgment, until I bring him back to life." These two angels therefore continuously pray for him until the Day of Judgment, and this prayer remains at the rate of one thousand rak'ahs per single rak'ah.
- [Reference needed]

#### The Intercessory Power on the Day of Judgment

Upon hearing this extensive Hadith, Sudayr exclaimed, "O master, O son of the Messenger of Allah, this means that when your lover sleeps and when he dies, his worship is better than his state of life, better than his state of wakefulness. He is worshipping more when he sleeps and dies."
- [Reference needed]

The Imam replied, "O Sudayr, this is nothing. Do you know what his status is? What his rank is? Do you know that on the Day of Judgment, about whomsoever he says to Allah, 'O Lord, grant him security,' Allah will grant him security." This is the ultimate status bestowed upon a Shia, a lover of the Ahl al-Bayt.
- [Reference needed]

### The Criterion for True Faith: Love and Hatred for Allah's Sake (Al-Hubb fi Allah wa Al-Bughd fi Allah)

The crucial question then arises: How is this exalted status achieved? And how can a person ascertain whether they truly possess the love of the Ahl al-Bayt in their heart? The most important criterion, the most important standard, is "Al-Hubb fi Allah wa Al-Bughd fi Allah" (Love for the sake of Allah and hatred for the sake of Allah). This means that if you love someone, this love should be purely for the sake of Allah, for the sake of the Messenger, and for the sake of the Ahl al-Bayt. Similarly, if you harbor hatred or enmity, it should also be solely for the sake of Allah, the Messenger, and the Ahl al-Bayt.

#### The Obligation of Love and Hatred for Allah's Sake

This concept is extensively discussed in the scholarly work "Wasail al-Shia" by the great twelfth-century (passed away 1104 AH) scholar, Shaykh al-Hurr al-Amili (may Allah be pleased with him). His book "Wasail al-Shia" is a fundamental text for all jurists and a prerequisite for anyone aspiring to become a Mujtahid (one who can derive religious rulings). In it, he dedicates a chapter titled "The Chapter of the Obligation of Love for the Sake of Allah." It emphasizes that it is obligatory that your love, hatred, giving, and withholding (depriving) should all be for the sake of Allah. This is a very important principle.

#### Tabarra (Disassociation) as a Shia Identity

The "red line" or ultimate criterion for us is the Wilayat (guardianship) of Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him). While love for Allah, the Messenger, and the Ahl al-Bayt is essential, disassociation (Bara'at), or Tabarra, from their enemies is equally necessary. This Tabarra is the distinguishing identity of Shias.
- [Reference needed]

It is acknowledged that the entire world praises Ali (peace be upon him), Imam Husayn (peace be upon him), and the Ahl al-Bayt – not just Shias, but all Muslims and even non-Muslims. For example, numerous books have been written on the Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon him) in Western universities, and the famous Christian scholar from Lebanon, George Jordac, authored "The Voice of Human Justice" about Ali (peace be upon him). Similarly, much work has been done on Imam Husayn (peace be upon him). So, while love for the Ahl al-Bayt is widespread, Tabarra (disassociation) is specifically the identity of the Shias; this is the true criterion and holds immense importance.

#### Completeness of Faith and Its Firmest Handhold

The Imam (peace be upon him) states:

"He whose love is for the sake of Allah, and whose hatred is for the sake of Allah, and who gives for the sake of Allah, he is the one whose faith is complete."
- [Reference needed]

Faith is perfected only when these three conditions are met. Furthermore, the Imam says: "The firmest handhold of faith (Urwah) is this: that you love for the sake of Allah, hate for the sake of Allah, give for the sake of Allah, and deprive people for the sake of Allah."
- [Reference needed]

"Urwah" means rope, and its plural is "Ura." This implies that even if you withhold something from someone, it should be with the intention that you are doing so because that person lacks the love of the progeny of Muhammad in their heart. This is a profound point for reflection. The true sign of faith is giving only on the basis that the recipient is a lover of the Ahl al-Bayt.

#### Love Between Believers: A Great Branch of Faith

In another Hadith, Imam Baqir (peace and blessings be upon him) states:

"The love of one believer for another believer is one of the greatest branches of faith."
- [Reference needed]

This mutual love between believers should be the sole criterion, free from personal matters. Often, people tend to mix religion with personal issues. For instance, if there is a personal disagreement, individuals might refuse to attend each other's religious gatherings (Majlis or Majlis Matam) or even social events like weddings. This behavior is indicative of a lack of faith. Personal conflicts should remain separate, and relationships should not be severed, especially when both parties share the love of Ali (peace be upon him). The crucial question to ask oneself is whether the other person still holds the love of Ali. If they have abandoned the path of Ali, that is a different matter, and they might be considered to have deviated from the religion. However, it is a common human failing to desire immediate divine punishment for anyone with whom we have a conflict, praying for them to be swallowed by the earth. This reflects a difference in spiritual capacity and understanding.

### The Exalted Status of Allah's Chosen Servants (Muqarrabun)

The Imam (peace be upon him) emphasizes that whoever acts upon these principles of love and hatred for Allah's sake will be among the chosen servants (Muqarrabun) of Allah.

#### The Example of Rashid al-Hajari

Consider the example of Janab Rashid al-Hajari, a great lover of the Commander of the Faithful (peace be upon him) from Kufa, who was deeply immersed in his love. Imam Kazim (peace be upon him) once stated that a particular person would die at a specific time. A man present, also an Ahl al-Bayt lover but of a lower spiritual level and living in a time of Taqiyyah (dissimulation), mentally questioned the Imam's claim of knowledge of the unseen. He merely *thought* to himself, "This Imam is claiming knowledge of the unseen... that he knows when everyone will live or die."
- [Reference needed]

The Imam (peace be upon him) immediately turned to him and said: "Are you doubting me, whether I have knowledge of the unseen or not? O lover of the Master," the Seventh Imam continued, "the lover of Ali, Rashid al-Hajari, knew who would die when, when he would pass away. So we are in any case better than Rashid. We are in any case better than Rashid."
- [Reference needed]

This remarkable rank of Rashid al-Hajari stemmed from his profound devotion. His own daughter once remarked to him, "Father, how much effort you put in for the guardianship (Wilayat) of Ali, how much you struggle." This indicates the immense dedication Rashid must have had, especially considering the turbulent and dangerous situation in Kufa at that time, where even revealing one's identity as a follower of Ali was a great risk. Yet, Janab Rashid al-Hajari never faltered.
- [Reference needed]

In response to his daughter, Rashid said, according to the narration: "Daughter, I do nothing. In the last days, a nation will come who will be so close to their Imam, they will have so much insight, that their insight will be greater than mine."
- [Reference needed]

This prophecy refers to the individuals of the era of the Twelfth Imam (peace be upon him), who will possess such deep attachment and insight that their spiritual perception will surpass even that of Rashid. This is the reward (Will) that will be granted to them in this world and manifested on the Day of Judgment.

### The Reward on the Day of Judgment: Pulpits of Light

Abu Basir narrates that he heard Imam Sadiq (peace and blessings be upon him) say:

"Whoever loves for the sake of Allah, on the Day of Judgment, Allah will seat him on the pulpits of light. Allah will create that light, Allah will create that pulpit, which will be a pulpit of light. On it, He will seat those people who love for the sake of Allah, who love for the sake of Allah. Their faces will be shining, their faces will be radiant, and their bodies will also be shining, not just the face but the body will also be shining. And the light of their pulpits will illuminate the entire Day of Judgment. It will illuminate the entire Day of Judgment. Until people will ask, 'Who are these people whose faces have so much light, whose bodies have so much light, and they are seated on pulpits of light? Because of them, there is light and only light in the entire Day of Judgment, light and only light.' So it will be said, 'These are the people who used to love for the sake of Allah, not for their personal matters, not for personal things.'"
- [Reference needed]

#### The Contrast: Believers in Light, Hypocrites in Darkness

This light that is earned is exclusively connected to this world. The light that will emanate from believers on the Day of Judgment is something they must earn *here*. There will be no opportunity to earn it in the hereafter. This is affirmed in the Quran, specifically in Surah Hadid. On the Day of Judgment, believers will be filled with light, their entire bodies radiating splendor. In that same vast field, the hypocrites, as stated in the Quran, will be in complete darkness.
- [Surah Al-Hadid, 57:13 - 14. Reference needed]

When the hypocrites see these people of light, the believers, they will desperately request, "Can we get some of your light? Can we get a little light of Wilayat (guardianship)? A little light of the love of Ali?" They will be answered, "No, if you want this light, go back to the world. Go back to the world and ask for light there." But, of course, there will be no chance to return to the world; the Day of Judgment will have arrived, and the time for earning is past.
- [Surah Al-Hadid, 57:13 - 14. Reference needed]

The Quran contains many such verses illustrating how hypocrites will be in darkness, recognizing and blaming each other: one saying, "I went astray because of you," and the other replying, "I went astray because of you." A voice of truth will declare, "Do not quarrel in front of Me." Their followers will regret, "I wish we had not followed them," while the leaders will retort, "Why did you come? Did we compel you?" These details are all mentioned in the Quran, emphasizing the need to read and reflect upon it.

#### The Importance of Reflecting on the Quran

The Ahl al-Bayt have greatly emphasized the Quran. Hadith states that it is appropriate for every Muslim to recite at least 50 verses daily upon returning home in the evening, and to read at least five of these verses with their meaning and reflect upon them. This reflection (Tadabbur) on the Quran is greatly rewarded. The Quran itself asks:

أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ أَمْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَا
"Do they not reflect on the Quran, or are there locks on their hearts?"
- [Surah Muhammad, 47:24. Reference needed]

Despite this emphasis, the speaker laments that in many homes today, the Quran is not regularly read. Often, the Quran received as a wedding gift remains untouched, gathering dust, only brought out to send off travelers. This indicates a general unfamiliarity with the Quran among the majority, especially in areas where emphasis on Madrasas (religious schools) is lacking. Where Madrasas are emphasized, children learn to read the Quran, but elsewhere, many are completely unfamiliar with it.

#### The Inseparability of Quran and Ahl al-Bayt

Yet, the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) declared:

إِنِّي تَارِكٌ فِيكُمْ مَا إِنْ تَمَسَّكْتُمْ بِهِمَا لَنْ تَضِلُّوا بَعْدِي أَبَدًا، كِتَابَ اللَّهِ وَ عِتْرَتِي أَهْلَ بَيْتِي. وَإِنَّهُمَا لَنْ يَفْتَرِقَا حَتَّى يَرِدَا عَلَيَّ الْحَوْضَ.
"I am leaving among you two weighty things (Thaqalayn): one is the Book of Allah and the other is my Ahl al-Bayt. These two will not be separated from each other until they come to me at the Pool of Kawthar."
- [Hadith al-Thaqalayn, Reference needed: Sahih Muslim, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad, etc.]

If someone claims to have the Quran but not the Ahl al-Bayt, or vice-versa, they are mistaken, for the Prophet explicitly stated their inseparability. The Quran is often referred to as the "silent Quran," and Ali (peace be upon him) as the "speaking Quran." To understand the Quran truly, one cannot do so without Ali (peace be upon him). The Quran itself states that it "guides to that which is most straight," pointing towards the Imam, meaning Ali ibn Abi Talib. And the Commander of the Faithful himself proclaimed, "I am the speaking Quran. Come to me, I am the speaking Quran." Yet, tragically, many people fled from this "speaking Quran."

### Consequences of Deviating from Divine Guidance

#### The Incident of the Pen and Ink

The speaker then connects this to a pivotal historical event. Upon the demise of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his progeny), he asked:

"Bring me a pen and ink so that I can write that thing after which you will never go astray."
- [Reference needed: Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim]

However, instead of obeying, people started making noise and causing a commotion. They declared: "The Book of Allah is sufficient for us." Neither the Quran itself nor the Prophet ever stated that the Quran alone is sufficient. Yet, those present claimed to understand more than Allah, the Quran, and the Prophet, asserting the Quran's sufficiency.

#### The Dangers of Following Ambiguous Verses and Personal Opinion

The Quran itself contradicts their claim. It states:

هُوَ الَّذِي أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ مِنْهُ آيَاتٌ مُّحْكَمَاتٌ هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ وَأُخَرُ مُتَشَابِهَاتٌ ۖ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمْ زَيْغٌ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ مَا تَشَابَهَ مِنْهُ ابْتِغَاءَ الْفِتْنَةِ وَابْتِغَاءَ تَأْوِيلِهِ ۗ وَمَا يَعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلَّا اللَّهُ ۗ وَالرَّاسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِهِ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا ۗ وَمَا يَذَّكَّرُ إِلَّا أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ
"He is the One Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are verses that are completely clear (Muhkamat); these are the foundation of the Book. And other verses are ambiguous (Mutashabihat), not clear. But those in whose hearts there is a deviation (Zaygh), meaning a disease or crookedness, who do not want true religion but rather desire Fitna (sedition), they follow the ambiguous verses, seeking to spread Fitna and to interpret the Quran themselves. And no one knows its interpretation except Allah and those who are deep in knowledge (Rāsikhūn fi al-'Ilm), whom Allah has given knowledge."
- [Surah Ali 'Imran, 3:7. Reference needed]

Thus, those whose religion is based on personal opinion, whom our tradition calls "Ahl al-Ra'y" (the people of opinion), diverge from the Shia school of thought, where only the Quran and the Hadith of the Prophet and Imams are accepted. The Commander of the Faithful himself challenged, "Where are those people who think that besides us, they are the ones whom Allah has given knowledge? Come forward, then we will see who has knowledge." In Nahj al-Balagha, he states, "These are rebelling against us, and they are attributing lies to us. Who are these people?"
- [Reference needed]

#### The "People of Remembrance" (Ahl al-Dhikr) and the City of Knowledge

The Quran further commands:

فَاسْأَلُوا أَهْلَ الذِّكْرِ إِن كُنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ
"Ask the people of remembrance if you do not know."
- [Surah An-Nahl, 16:43; Surah Al-Anbiya, 21:7. Reference needed]

When the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) asked his companions, "Who are the people of remembrance?" they surprisingly answered, "The Jews." The Prophet immediately corrected them: "No. If they were Jews, they would teach you the Torah. Why would they teach you the Quran?" Then they suggested, "The Christians." Again, the Prophet replied, "If they were, they would teach you the Gospel, the Bible. Why would they teach you the Quran?" When they finally asked, "Then who are the people of remembrance?" just then, the Commander of the Faithful arrived, and the Prophet said, "This is the people of remembrance."

If this interpretation is not accepted, then surely the famous Hadith must be:

أَنَا مَدِينَةُ الْعِلْمِ وَعَلِيٌّ بَابُهَا فَمَنْ أَرَادَ الْعِلْمَ فَلْيَأْتِ الْبَابَ
"I am the city of knowledge, and Ali is its gate. So whoever wishes to enter the city of knowledge should come through its gate."
- [Reference needed: Tirmidhi, Mustadrak al-Hakim, al-Kamil by Ibn Adi, etc.]

Anyone who does not enter through the gate is considered a thief, regardless of their status. Some individuals, likened to thieves who jump over walls, fabricated Hadith after the ban on Hadith was lifted. They claimed, "The Prophet said, 'I am the city of knowledge, Ali is its gate, so-and-so is its roof, so-and-so is its veranda, so-and-so is its window.'" They assigned different parts of the city to different individuals. This lack of logical thought, when Allah blinds someone's intellect, prevents them from understanding even the most obvious truths. Mir Hamid Husayn in his monumental work "Abaqat" dedicates an entire volume, "Hadith Madinat al-'Ilm," proving that all such fabricated Hadiths about roofs, windows, and verandas are false, and only the Hadith, "I am the city of knowledge, and Ali is its gate," is authentic.

Despite the Prophet's explicit command and the Quran's directive, people rejected the guidance, saying, "The Book of Allah is sufficient for us."

#### The Prophecy of 73 Sects

The tragic consequence was precisely what the Prophet (peace be upon him and his progeny) had prophesied:

"After me, there will be 73 sects in my Ummah."
- [Reference needed: Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, etc.]

Compared to 71 sects among the Jews and 72 among the Christians, Muslims would be divided into 73. This division occurred solely because they abandoned the door of the Ahl al-Bayt. While some argue that there are also many sects among the Shias, this too resulted from them abandoning the Imam of their time. Had they adhered to the Hadith Qudsi and the teachings of the Prophet and Imams, they would never have deviated.

### The Departure of Imam Husayn (AS) from Medina

#### The Demand for Allegiance to Yazid

This chain of events continued until it reached the demand for allegiance to Yazid. All historians agree that Yazid was a drunkard, a debauchee, and an perpetrator of evil deeds. Yet, allegiance was demanded from Imam Husayn (peace be upon him) for such a person. Consequently, the master of the martyrs decided to leave Medina.

#### A Witness Account of the Departure

On the 28th of Rajab, Imam Husayn (peace be upon him) began his departure from Medina. Abdullah ibn Sinan narrates:
"I was in Medina on the 28th of Rajab. I saw that there was despair all around. Everyone was very worried and looked very disappointed. I asked, 'Brothers, what is this despair? Why all this sadness? Why does everyone look sad?'"

The people replied, "Are you a traveler?" I said, "I am a resident of Kufa." They said, "Don't you know that the grandson of the Prophet is leaving Medina? Medina is about to be deserted."
- [Reference needed]

Abdullah ibn Sinan continues, "I thought that I should also see how the grandson of the Prophet departs from Medina and how the people of Medina bid him farewell. I came and stood outside the Bayt al-Sharaf (the noble house). I saw that there was a large crowd outside the Bayt al-Sharaf. The people of Medina were standing to see that Husayn is departing, Husayn is leaving Medina."
- [Reference needed]

Just then, after a little while, I saw two young men who moved the crowd away, saying, "Move away, move away, the ladies of the Prophet's household are coming. The ladies of the Prophet's household are about to mount. Move away." They cleared the gathering. A noble lady came out and mounted. In this way, the noble ladies kept coming and mounting. I saw that a noble lady came, and a 13-year-old handsome young man helped her mount. I asked, "Who is this?" They said, "This is Hasan's orphan, Qasim, and the one mounting is Umm Farwa."
- [Reference needed]

A little later, another noble lady emerged, and a young man lifted the curtain of the litter and helped her mount by holding her arm. I asked, "Who?" They said, "This is the look-alike of the Prophet, Ali Akbar, helping his mother, Umm Layla, mount."
- [Reference needed]

Now, a little later, another noble lady emerged. And a young man who was a great martyr, he helped her mount with great respect. I said, "Who is this?" They said, "This is Ali's younger daughter, Umm Kulthum, and the one helping her mount is Ali's son, Abbas ibn Ali."
- [Reference needed]

Up until this point, while the ladies were mounting, Husayn was seated on a chair and was overseeing all the arrangements. Suddenly, a lady emerged. As soon as the lady emerged, Husayn stood up from his chair. Someone held his sandals, someone held his arm, someone lifted the curtain of the litter. He helped her mount with great care. I asked, "Who is this?" They said, "This is Ali's elder daughter, Zainab."
- [Reference needed]

O the honorable ones of the Hashimite clan, come on the 11th of Muharram, come to Karbala and see how Zainab is being whipped, and her back, and she is being mounted on such a camel on which there is no saddle, nothing. Zainab was mounted and tied to the camel.
- [Reference needed]

When all the ladies were mounted, Husayn came forward once and said to his brother Abbas, whom he was going to make his standard-bearer in Karbala, "Abbas, bring my steed." Immediately, Abbas brought the steed, brought the horse. He helped Husayn mount. I will say, "O, on the afternoon of Ashura, who will help me mount? Who will bring my Lord?" When no one answered, Husayn looked towards the battlefield. The bodies were lying there. Husayn called out the name of each one. "O my riders, O my brave ones." May the curse of Allah be upon the oppressors.

### Concluding Supplication and Mourning

O Lord, hasten the reappearance of the Imam of our time. O Lord, hasten the reappearance of the Imam of our time. O Lord, hasten the reappearance of the Imam of our time. Count us among his helpers and supporters. Remove the worries of those who are distressed. Grant relief to those who are in debt. Grant righteous and virtuous children to those who are childless. Return those who are far from their homeland safely. O Lord, wherever the Shias of Haydar Karrar are in the world, protect their lives, property, honor, and dignity. Amen. Protect the great scholars and Maraji'. Amen. Protect the holy sites. Protect those who protect them. Grant us the pilgrimage of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad in this world and the intercession of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad in the hereafter. Matam of Husayn.
