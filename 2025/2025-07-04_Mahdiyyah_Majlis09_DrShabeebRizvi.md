The lecture began with heart-rending elegiac verses and petitions:

It was a ruse, father, when your killer struck me.
With every slap, I, Sakina, cried out your name.
When your killer struck me, father, he grabbed me by my hair and slapped me repeatedly.
I begged for your head from the merciless one, father.
When your killer struck me, father.
The earrings you gifted me, the heartless one tore them from my ears, father.
When your killer struck me, father.

#### Petition to Abbas (A.S.)

First, convey my greetings to him.
Then say that a servant yearns for you back home.

#### A Prayer for Zainab (A.S.)

O night, do not fall, for Zainab will be ruined. At dawn, she will be separated from her brother.
O night, do not fall, for Zainab will be ruined.
Let Sakina sleep, for she will not be able to sleep again. Even if she wants to cry, she will not be able to. She will not be able to meet Asghar again.
O night, do not fall, for Zainab will be ruined.
The frightened children and the terrified mothers. Let me give my blessings to Ali Akbar to my heart's content. I still have to ward off the evil eye from Muhammad.
O night, do not fall, for Zainab will be ruined.
O night, spread out as far as you can. Tomorrow, the signs of the camp will be erased. This scene remains only until Ali Akbar's mourning.
O night, do not fall, for Zainab will be ruined.
The thirst of the children of the moon is still there. There is some longing in the eyes, and some hope remains. But my brother, my Abbas, is still here.
O night, do not fall, for Zainab will be ruined.
The vessel of the family of Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy family) still remains. The chest of Shabbir is there for his daughter to sleep on. Sakina is rocking Ali Asghar's cradle.
O night, do not fall, for Zainab will be ruined.
Tomorrow, who will listen to my cries and pleas? The dagger will be on my brother's throat. Not just the tent, even the veil on my head will be gone.
O night, do not fall, for Zainab will be ruined.
O night, for a moment, let there be peace. My loved ones will fall in the ranks of the enemies. These moon-like faces will be covered in blood.
O night, do not fall, for Zainab will be ruined.

### Introduction: The Divine Principle of Worship

The lecture commenced with a fundamental principle regarding worship and its reward, as stated by the Master of Martyrs, Hussain ibn Ali (peace be upon him):

مَن عَبَدَ اللهَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِهِ، أعطاهُ اللهُ فَوقَ أمانِيِّهِ وكِفايَتِهِ
Man 'abada Allaha haqqa 'ibadatihi, a'tahullahu fawqa amanihhi wa kifayatihi.
- [Reference needed]

"He who worships Allah as He ought to be worshipped, Allah gives him more than his desires and needs." Whatever he desires, whatever his need is, Allah will give him more than that.

The speaker explained that the series of points he has been presenting emphasizes that knowledge (Ma'rifat) is essential for worship. When a person possesses true knowledge, they can genuinely recognize the Imam. Consequently, they can obey the Imam correctly, learn the proper way of worship, understand how worship is performed, and ultimately attain felicity—meaning how they can become inhabitants of Paradise and achieve success in both this world and the hereafter.

### The Essentiality of a Divine Proof (Hujjat)

Yesterday, the speaker explained that the presence of a divine proof (Hujjat) on earth is essential. This is because, without a divine proof, a person would never know the right path. This proof is called a Hujjat because through it, Allah completes His argument, leaving no excuse or pretext for people. Many proofs support this necessity. Allama Majlisi (may Allah be pleased with him), in his book *Bihar al-Anwar*, specifically in the Book of Imamate, dedicates his first chapter to this topic:

Bab al-Idtirar ilal-Hujjah
- [Reference needed]

"The Chapter on the Necessity of the Proof." In this chapter, he compiles numerous Hadith and proofs stated by the Imams, demonstrating why such a guide is necessary and how, without this guide, a person will surely go astray and wander from the path.

#### Imam Baqir's Proof: The Guide for Earthly and Heavenly Paths

Imam Baqir (peace be upon him) provided a compelling proof:

"When one of you travels a few kilometers (yakhruju ahadukum farasikh), that is, when he travels a short distance, for example, from one city to another, what does he do? He seeks a guide for himself (ittakhadha daleelan)."
- [Reference needed]

In any city, country, or anywhere in the world, a person seeks a guide to show them places and explain what is what, because they are unfamiliar with it. No one would attempt trial and error in such a situation, as it would lead nowhere. Especially if the journey is important, a guide becomes crucial to show the way, explain directions, and maximize benefit in minimal time.

The Imam then applies this analogy: "And you people are completely ignorant of the paths of the sky, you are already ignorant of the paths of the earth." This implies that while people might have some limited knowledge of earthly paths, they are utterly ignorant of the heavenly paths – that is, the hereafter and the unseen.

#### Amir al-Mu'minin Ali's Knowledge of the Unseen

This statement by Imam Baqir connects directly to the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him), who repeatedly declared from the pulpit:

سَلُونِي قَبْلَ أَنْ تَفْقِدُونِي
Saluni qabla an tafqiduni
- [Reference needed]

"Ask me before you lose me." He emphasized that once he was gone, there would be no one left to ask. He further asserted: "I am more aware of the paths of the heavens than the paths of the earth." He challenged people to ask him about the seven heavens, about anything they wished.

#### The Ignorance of the Arabs and True Inquiry

The speaker highlighted the profound ignorance of the Arabs of that time. Instead of asking profound questions about the heavens or divine knowledge, they would pose trivial questions like, "How many grains of sand are in the desert?" or "How many stars are in the sky?" Such questions held no true benefit.

It was primarily people of other religions, possessing a modicum of sense, who would approach Ali (peace be upon him) with meaningful inquiries. For instance, a Jew once asked someone sitting on a throne, "Where is Allah?" The response was, "Allah is above." The Jew immediately retorted, "If He is above, does that mean the earth is empty of Allah? He is not on earth?" The individual became angry and expelled the Jew, accusing him of defiling the mosque.

This incident, a well-known Hadith, describes how the Commander of the Faithful, Salman al-Farsi, then guided these curious individuals to Ali (peace be upon him). When they asked Ali the same question, "Where is Allah?", he responded, "The question is wrong." He explained that Allah created space and encompasses all space, so it is incorrect to ask "where" of Him. He created time and space, thus questions concerning time and space cannot be asked about Him. Allah encompasses all space, all time, and everything. Therefore, questions should be asked *about* Him, not *where* He is. In this manner, Ali (peace be upon him) answered many profound questions, leading these individuals to understand the unique position and knowledge of the Ahlul Bayt.

#### The Perpetual Necessity of the Imam

Imam Baqir (peace be upon him) concluded his argument by stating: "You are completely ignorant of the paths of the sky, you are already ignorant of the paths of the earth." This means that while people might grasp a few things about the earthly life, they have no knowledge whatsoever about the unseen and the hereafter.

The Quran itself affirms this lack of human knowledge:

وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّوحِ قُلِ الرُّوحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّي وَمَا أُوتِيتُم مِّنَ الْعِلْمِ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا
Wa yas'alunaka 'anir-roohi qulir-roohu min amri Rabbi wa ma ooteetum minal 'ilmi illa qaleela.
- [Reference needed]

"And they ask you, [O Muhammad], about the soul. Say, 'The soul is of the affair of my Lord. And you have not been given of knowledge except a little.'"

Allah instructs people to "Go and ask the people of remembrance (ahl adh-dhikr)." The speaker stressed that just as one consults a doctor for sickness, a lawyer for legal issues, or an engineer for engineering problems, similarly, in religious matters, one must turn to the Imams and the Ahlul Bayt. And the Ahlul Bayt themselves directed people to consult Maraji' (religious authorities), scholars, and jurists in matters of jurisprudence, and to study narrations and Hadith. However, many Muslims abandoned the door of the Ahlul Bayt, turning away and even becoming their enemies, leading to ongoing mockery and ridicule.

Therefore, the Imam says, "Seek a proof for yourselves, seek a guide for yourselves," and that guide is the proof of Allah. The Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him) pointed to the sky and supplicated:

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ آلِ مُحَمَّد
Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammadin wa aali Muhammad.
- [Reference needed]

"O Lord, it is necessary that Your proofs be on the earth, Your guides whom You have appointed, they must be on the earth. It is necessary, proof after proof, a guide is necessary in every era."

The speaker reiterated that the proof (Imam) is the axis of the universe, the foundation upon which existence is established. He repeated a profound narration: "The proof is before the creation, the proof of Allah is with the creation, and the proof of Allah is after the creation." This means that all of creation is like a body, and the proof is its soul. The soul of the entire creation is the proof of Allah, for whose sake Allah created the universe. Thus, the presence of the Imam, the proof, is perpetually necessary, one after another, in every era.

#### Unity Through the Rope of Allah

Amir al-Mu'minin (peace be upon him) articulated a key reason for the necessity of the Imam: "So that the followers of Your friends, that is, the followers of the Imams, do not become scattered, do not go here and there." They should remain united around one scholar, one guide, one leader who is present in every era. This aligns with the Quranic injunction:

وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا
Wa'tasimu bihablillahi jamee'an wa la tafarraqu.
- [Reference needed]

"And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided."

The speaker emphasized that the only basis for unity among Muslims is the firm rope of Allah. If Muslims desire unity and solidarity, the only path is around Ali ibn Abi Talib and his progeny. Those who choose other paths may do so, as Allah has granted freedom in this world, but true unity will remain elusive. This is because truth and falsehood can never coexist in one place. Allah has created only one heart in any human being, not two. Therefore, the heart that loves Adam cannot harbor love for Satan. The heart that loves Abel cannot love Cain. The heart that loves Abraham cannot love Nimrod. The heart that loves Moses cannot love Pharaoh. And the heart that loves the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family) cannot love Abu Jahl and Abu Lahab. Similarly, the heart that loves Ali ibn Abi Talib can never love those who usurped the right of guardianship.

The Imam's purpose, therefore, is "So that the followers of Your friends do not wander here and there, but remain in one place where the proof of Allah is." This proof exists "Whether apparent or hidden (zahiran ghayra muta')."

### The Imam's Role During Occultation

The Imam may be apparent but not obeyed, as was the case with Amir al-Mu'minin Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him) from 11 AH to 36 AH after the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family). During this time, despite his presence, people did not obey him. The same was true for Imam Hasan Mujtaba and subsequent Imams, until the twelfth Imam, the Imam of our time (may Allah hasten his noble reappearance), went into occultation.

#### Benefit from the Occulted Imam

Regarding the occultation, the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) states that even if the Imam is physically in occultation and the world is dominated by the government of falsehood, there is still benefit from him. This is likened to the sun hidden behind clouds; people continue to benefit from its existence, even if its full glory is not apparent. The speaker cited Imam Sadiq (peace be upon him) who said: "Every nation will be given a chance to establish its own government. Everyone will be given a chance to establish a government. You make it. Every person who comes with an idea, he will also be allowed to form a government. And our government will come in the end times, in the last days." This allows for no excuses when the Imam's golden era arrives, as everyone will have had their chance to rule. This golden era, prophesied in all religions, will be a time when the world is filled with justice and fairness, and humanity reaches its perfection.

Even in occultation, the Imam or Imams "have spread their knowledge in the hearts of the believers, 'mabsusun', meaning to spread, to distribute, to distribute their knowledge, their etiquette, all things to them, and they are continuously distributing it to the believers." This is why, in Ziyarat Al-Yasin, believers say:

السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ حِينَ تَقْرَأُ وَتُبَيِّنُ
As-salamu 'alayka heena taqra' wa tubayyin.
- [Reference needed]

"Peace be upon you when you recite the Quran and you explain it." The Imam, even today in occultation, has special students to whom he explains the Quran, narrates Hadith, and imparts knowledge.

#### The Imam's Knowledge: `Hadith` and `Laylat al-Qadr`

The sayings of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family) and the infallible Imams (peace be upon them) are called `Hadith`. The Arabic word `Hadith` means "new." The Quran itself is called `Hadith`, even `ahsanal Hadith` (the best of Hadith), meaning "the best new thing" or "the best new talk." `Hadith` refers to something that did not exist before but came into existence later. The Imam continuously explains his knowledge to the people, ensuring that the chain of religious teachings and the knowledge of the Ahlul Bayt never ceases. If it were to stop, the system of the world would cease.

Allah renews this knowledge through various means, one of which is the Night of Power (Laylat al-Qadr). Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) emphasized that when discussing Imamate with an opponent, one should use the verses of Surah Qadr:

بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ
Inna anzalnahu fi laylatil qadr.
- [Reference needed]
"Indeed, We sent it down during the Night of Power."

وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ
Wa ma adraka ma laylatul qadr.
- [Reference needed]
"And what will make you know what the Night of Power is?"

لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ
Laylatul qadri khayrum min alfi shahr.
- [Reference needed]
"The Night of Power is better than a thousand months."

تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ
Tanazzalul mala'ikatu war-roohu feeha bi-idhni rabbihim min kulli amr.
- [Reference needed]
"The angels and the Spirit descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter."

On Laylat al-Qadr, angels and the Holy Spirit descend with all matters—everything that will happen that year, including sustenance for the entire universe. The thing they bring is called `amr` (command). The one upon whom it descends is called `Wali al-Amr` (the guardian of the command). The plural of `Wali` is `Uli al-Amr`.

#### The Meaning of `Uli al-Amr` (Those in Authority)

The Quran, in Surah Nisa, verse 59, commands:

يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنكُمْ
Ya ayyuhalladheena amanu, atee'ullaha wa atee'ur-rasoola wa ulil amri minkum.
- [Reference needed]

"O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you."

The speaker pointed out that despite this clear verse, interpretations of `Uli al-Amr` became problematic, with some claiming it referred to "kings." This led to confusion about which king should be obeyed. This issue is not new; Allama Iqbal, a century ago, lamented the disunity among Muslims, asking, "These are Muslims, seeing them, the Jews would be ashamed. You are Sayyid, you are Mirza, you are Afghan, you are everything, tell me, are you also a Muslim?" This reflects a long history of Muslims struggling with unity and deviation from the true path.

#### Historical Division and Conflict

The speaker highlighted that there has never been a "golden era" in Muslim history, except for the four years of Amir al-Mu'minin Ali's apparent rule, during which he attempted to reform the Muslims. However, the Muslims resisted, engaging in three major wars against him. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family) had explicitly stated, "Ali is with the truth, and the truth is with Ali." Yet, Muslims fought against the truth and later blamed Ali (peace be upon him) for historical events.

The three major wars during Ali's caliphate were:
1.  **The Battle of the Camel**: Over 30,000 companions were killed. The speaker questioned who initiated the attack, urging people to read history to understand the aggression against Ali. He noted the contradiction in saying those who fight the caliph are outside Islam, yet making exceptions for those who fought Ali.
2.  **The Battle of Siffin**: This conflict lasted 18 months, resulting in the death of hundreds of thousands of Muslims.
3.  **The Battle of Nahrawan**: After Siffin, a new group, the Kharijites, emerged, conspired, and attacked Amir al-Mu'minin.

The speaker acknowledged that much of history has been distorted, but truths can still be found through just and thorough reading. He reminded the audience that the first verse revealed in Islam was "Iqra'" (Read), indicating Allah's desire for this nation to be a reading one, though unfortunately, it often was not.

#### The Imams' Continuous Training and Knowledge Dissemination

The speaker concluded this section by reiterating that even if the Imam is in apparent occultation, those who desire to can still benefit from his existence, much like people benefit from the sun even when it is hidden by clouds. While the benefit may not be as complete as during the Imam's full reappearance, it is nonetheless real.

He noted that Muslims never gave any Imam the full opportunity to rule as the twelfth Imam will, God willing, after his reappearance. Despite this, the Imams, from Amir al-Mu'minin to the twelfth Imam, continuously trained their followers.

An example is Imam Hasan al-Askari (peace be upon him), the eleventh Imam, whose circumstances were extremely difficult. He was confined to a military cantonment (`Askar`), meaning he was constantly under surveillance, with spies even within his own home. This explains why the birth of the Imam of our time was kept hidden. Even his wife, Lady Narjis, a princess, lived as a handmaiden to maintain secrecy. The speaker advised that if one's prayers are unanswered, they should seek intercession through Lady Narjis, saying, "I ask you for the sake of your noble mother, Lady Narjis," as she made immense sacrifices.

Lady Hakimah, Imam Hasan al-Askari's paternal aunt, was unaware of the impending birth until the very last moment. She observed Lady Narjis showing no signs of pregnancy, leading to a momentary doubt. Imam Hasan al-Askari (peace be upon him) reassured her, "Aunty, do not fall into doubt. Allah's promise will surely be fulfilled this night."

The speaker then narrated an incident where some Shia from Astarabad (Iran) traveled to Samarra to meet Imam Hasan al-Askari (peace be upon him) due to oppression by a Zaydi minister. The Imam informed them that the oppressor's work was finished and they should return. When they hesitated, he told them to leave their two young boys with him to be taught Quranic commentary until they could verify the news. The boys ended up staying for seven years, daily learning the commentary. The Imam instructed them to write down as much as they could. This commentary, now available in one volume attributed to Imam Hasan al-Askari (peace be upon him), was originally 120 volumes, according to historians. Many scholars and jurists also participated in these lessons and transcribed the commentary. Unfortunately, much of this knowledge was lost when libraries were burned by those who claimed to be followers of Islam but were adept at destroying books, demonstrating a lack of academic answers.

Thus, the Imams continuously spread their knowledge, ensuring it remained among the people.

### The Importance of Choosing the Right Imam

The speaker emphasized the critical importance of selecting the correct Imam, as it is directly related to one's hereafter.

#### Resurrection with One's Imam

The Quran states in Surah Bani Isra'il, verse 71:

يَوْمَ نَدْعُو كُلَّ أُنَاسٍ بِإِمَامِهِمْ
Yawma nad'u kulla unasin bi-imamihim.
- [Reference needed]

"On the Day of Resurrection, We will call every people with their Imam."

The Imam explained in its commentary that there are two types of Imams:
1.  **The Imam who calls to guidance**: This is the Imam appointed by Allah, connected to the knowledge of the unseen, and aware of the commentary of the Quran. Those who respond to the call of this Imam will be resurrected with him. This is why believers repeatedly say, "I am at your service, O Hussain" (`Labbayka ya Husayn`). The speaker revealed that the slogan of the Imam of our time (may Allah hasten his noble reappearance) will be "O avengers of Hussain!" (`Ya Latharat al-Husayn`), indicating his connection to Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) and, by extension, to all 12 Imams. By accepting their invitation in this world, believers will be with them in the hereafter.

#### The Consequences of Following False Leadership

2.  **The Imam who calls to misguidance**: This is someone who has no right to be an Imam. He is ignorant, has no connection to the knowledge of the unseen, and was not appointed by Allah or the Messenger. He is unfamiliar with the Quran and Hadith. Such an individual is either made an Imam by people or declares himself one. The speaker noted that merely holding governmental power does not indicate eligibility, as corrupt individuals often rule. Those who accept the invitation of this misguided Imam and follow him will be resurrected with him.

This distinction is further clarified by Surah Shura, verse 7:

فَرِيقٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ وَفَرِيقٌ فِي السَّعِيرِ
Fareequn fil-jannati wa fareequn fis-sa'eer.
- [Reference needed]

"A party in Paradise and a party in the Blaze." One group will go to Paradise with the rightful Imam, and the other to Hell with the false Imam.

The speaker provided the example of Pharaoh from Surah Hud, verses 97-98:

وَاتَّبَعُوا أَمْرَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَا أَمْرُ فِرْعَوْنَ بِرَشِيدٍ
Wa'taba'u amra fir'awn, wa ma amru fir'awna bi-rasheed.
- [Reference needed]
"And they followed the command of Pharaoh, while the command of Pharaoh was not right."

The Quran explicitly states that Pharaoh's rule was not righteous, demonstrating that mere governance is not a sign of legitimacy.

يَقْدُمُ قَوْمَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَأَوْرَدَهُمُ النَّارَ وَبِئْسَ الْوِرْدُ الْمَوْرُودُ
Yaqdumu qawmahu yawmal qiyamati fa-awradahumun-nar wa bi'sal wirdul mawrood.

"Pharaoh will lead his people on the Day of Resurrection and will bring them to the Fire; and wretched is the place to which they are brought."

Such verses underscore the importance of following the divinely appointed Imams, who continuously train and guide their followers.

### The Spirit of Sacrifice and Loyalty to the Imams

The essential condition for being close to the Imams is possessing the spirit of sacrifice. If one loves the world, it will eventually pass away, and such a person will inevitably abandon the Imam.

#### The Example of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari

Abu Dharr, a great companion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family), could have easily gained worldly possessions if he had chosen to compromise. However, after the martyrdom of the Messenger, he would stand holding the handle of the Kaaba door and declare:

"O people, I am Abu Dharr. Whoever knows me, knows me, I am Abu Dharr. Whoever does not know me, then listen, I am Jundab, I am a companion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family). I tell you that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family) said, 'After me, follow the Quran and the Ahlul Bayt.' I do not lie, nor has a lie been told to me."

No Muslim can deny Abu Dharr's integrity or his status as a tremendous companion. Yet, during the era of the third ruler, when many Jews were prevalent and Abu Dharr would publicly rebuke wrongdoings, he became a "headache." The third ruler decided to send him to Syria, hoping the governor there would manage him.

Upon arriving in Syria, the governor, Muawiya, had built a magnificent palace. He invited everyone for its grand opening, including Abu Dharr, who arrived in simple clothes, holding a staff, amidst a crowd of well-dressed Muslims and Quran memorizers. Muawiya approached him and asked, "O companion of the Messenger of Allah, how do you like my palace?" Abu Dharr responded, "I am thinking." When asked what he was thinking, Abu Dharr directly asked, "Did I build this with my own money or with public money?" Muawiya remained silent. Abu Dharr then continued, "I will answer. If you built it with your own money, then it is extravagance." He reminded them that the Quran calls the extravagant "brothers of the devils" (ikhwan ash-shayateen). "And if you built it with public money, then it is stolen property."

This public humiliation caused Muawiya to complain to Medina. Abu Dharr was then sent back. In Medina, he continued his rebukes. When Ka'b al-Ahbar, who had converted to Islam in the 9th year of Hijra, objected to Abu Dharr's "un-Islamic" statements, Abu Dharr struck him on the head with his staff, saying, "Hey, son of a Jew, will you teach me Islam?"

Deemed an unbearable problem, Abu Dharr was then exiled to Rabza, where he died in complete isolation and poverty. His wife, Umm Dharr, was crying as he was dying because they did not even have money for a shroud. Abu Dharr reassured her, recalling a Hadith from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family): "O Abu Dharr, you will die in such a place that when there is no one, a few believers will come and they will arrange for your burial." He instructed his wife to stand on the highway. Despite her skepticism that the highway was now empty of pilgrims, she obeyed. Eventually, she saw some people approaching rapidly on horses. They turned out to be believers who, upon learning it was Abu Dharr, provided him a proper burial. The Ahlul Bayt always make arrangements for their loyal companions.

### The Tragedy of Karbala: The Martyrdom of Ali Asghar (A.S.)

However, when it came to the Ahlul Bayt themselves, the situation in Karbala was unimaginable. Everyone was martyred. Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) raised his voice in distress, crying out: "Is there anyone to help us who will help us? Is there anyone to give us refuge who will give us refuge? Is there anyone who will defend the sanctuary of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family)? Who will save the sanctuary of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family)?"

Suddenly, a commotion erupted in the tents. Hussain (peace be upon him) went to the tent door and asked his sister, Zainab, "Sister Zainab, what is this commotion?" She replied, "Brother, you raised your voice of distress, Asghar has thrown himself from the cradle." Hussain requested, "Sister, bring Asghar, give him to me." Zainab responded, "Asghar does not come into anyone's lap, you yourself go and see."

It is written in the Maqtal that Hussain (peace be upon him) approached the cradle. What the father said and what the son understood remains unknown, but it is recorded that as soon as Hussain uttered some words, Asghar slowly came into his father's lap. Hussain took the child and walked towards the enemy. As he reached the tent door, he saw Rabab, Asghar's mother, standing. "Rabab, why are you standing here?" Rabab replied, "Master, I am seeing that whoever has gone since morning has not come back alive." Hussain (peace be upon him) consoled her, "Rabab, until now, those who went, the enemy thought that they came with the intention of fighting. Hey, six-month-old babies don't fight. Why would they kill him?" His words reassured Rabab's heart.

Hussain (peace be upon him) carried Asghar and stood on a high place, calling out: "O Muslims, is there any Muslim among you? Islam says that you should give water to the thirsty. My child has been thirsty for three days." There was no response. Hussain then asked a second question: "Hey, if you are not Muslims, is there not even a father among you? Look at the condition of my child." Still, silence.

Now Hussain asked a third question: "Hey, don't you see how my child is writhing? Don't you see how he is in the throes of death?" He described `talaz'i` as the state of a fish taken out of water, writhing in its final moments, opening and closing its mouth until it dies. He said, "You see what his state of talaz'i is like, how he is dying." At this, the wretched ones turned their faces and began to cry.

Umar ibn Sa'd, sensing a potential revolution among his troops, called out, "Where is Harmala?" Harmala, the accursed one, stepped forward. He produced a three-pronged arrow, a type typically used by Arabs for hunting large animals. This arrow was aimed at a six-month-old baby. Harmala aimed at Asghar's throat. When the arrow struck, the child convulsed in his father's arms. The arrow pierced Hussain's hands as well.

Hussain (peace be upon him) bent down and looked. Asghar was smiling, conveying, "Father, don't worry." Hussain was faced with an impossible situation. How could he take the child back to the tent in such a state? As he performs the rituals of Ashura, Hussain (peace be upon him) walks a short distance, reciting:

إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ
Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un.
- [Reference needed]

"Indeed, we belong to Allah, and to Him we shall return." He would walk a little, then return, repeating the verse. Hussain performed this act multiple times. Finally, Hussain decided that since the child had departed this world, his mother should not be deprived of a final look. He placed his cloak over the child's face.

He came to the door of the tent and called out, "Rabab." As soon as Hussain called out, "Rabab," it is written in the Maqtal that Rabab came from one side, and Sakina came from the other. Sakina, being a child, ran and reached first, asking, "Father, has my brother drunk water? Now my brother is not thirsty, is he?" While Sakina was still asking, Rabab arrived. When Rabab arrived, Hussain removed the cloak. She saw the horrifying sight of her six-month-old child with a three-pronged arrow in his throat. Rabab then recited, "O my son, are children like you also slaughtered?"

### Concluding Supplication

O Lord, hasten the reappearance of the Imam of our time. Count us among his helpers and supporters. Remove the troubles of those who are in distress. Grant relief to those who are in debt.
