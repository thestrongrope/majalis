> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Central Teaching**: True worship of Allah is only possible through proper Ma'rifat (recognition) of the Imams. Knowledge precedes worship, and without recognition of the Imam of the time, all worship becomes meaningless.

> [!NOTE]
> **Hadith of Thaqalayn**: The Holy Prophet (PBUH) left two precious things - the Quran and his Holy Family (Ahlul Bayt). These two will never separate until they meet at the Pond of Kauthar.

### 1. The Quranic Mandate: Forgiveness, Righteousness, and Turning from the Ignorant

Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has said in His Glorious Book:

**خذ العفو وامر بالعرف واعرض عن الجاهلين**
Take to forgiveness, enjoin what is right, and turn away from the ignorant.
- [Reference needed]

This noble verse is verse number 199 of Surah Al-A'raf. In this noble verse, the Almighty God’s decree is: **خذ العفو** (Take to forgiveness). This means that you should make forgiveness, good manners, and good character your profession, meaning forgive people. Treat people with good conduct.

And **و امر بالعرف** (and enjoin what is right), and command them to do what is good. Yesterday, I presented to you what Ma'ruf (what is right) means. Ma'ruf means that which intellect accepts and approves, and from which a person derives pleasure, that which a person finds good; in English, it means a person gets pleasure from that thing.

And **و اعرض عن الجاهلين** (and turn away from the ignorant), meaning turn your face away from people. So, regarding **خذ العفو** (take to forgiveness), I had presented on that yesterday. Now, today’s discussion is a bit about **و امر بالعرف** (and enjoin what is right). Look, one manifestation of **و امر بالعرف**, its very first manifestation of 'Urf (what is right), meaning commanding what is right, is the Wilayah (Guardianship) of Commander of the Faithful.

And **و اعرض عن الجاهلين** (turn away from the ignorant), meaning turn away from those individuals who are not ready to accept the Wilayah (Guardianship) of Commander of the Faithful and are obstinate that they will not accept the Wilayah (Guardianship) of Commander of the Faithful and the 11 Imams after him. So, turn away from them.

Anyway, if we take it in its literal meaning: that you forgive people. Command what is right, command good things, and turn away from the ignorant. Turning away means that you should not react to the ignorant in front of them. When an ignorant person talks to you, do not react to them in the way ignorant people usually react to each other, and in the way an ignorant person reacts. As it is mentioned in another verse of Surah Al-Furqan:

**عباد الرحمن الذین یمشون علی الارض هونا و اذا خاطبهم الجاهلون قالوا سلاما**
And the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth easily, and when the ignorant address them, they say, "Peace."
- [Reference needed]

They are the servants of Allah, the Most Merciful. **عباد الرحمن** (The servants of the Most Merciful) **الذین یمشون علی الارض هونا** (who walk upon the earth easily) – when they walk on the earth, they don't walk with great pomp and show, with ten people walking in front and ten behind. They don't walk like that; they walk lightly and with moderation. Moderation means moderately, neither walking too arrogantly nor bending so much that people walk all over them. That is also another verse of the Quran, which I will present to you shortly.

So, **عباد الرحمن الذین یمشون علی الارض هونا** (The servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth easily) is a verse from Surah Al-Furqan. And **و اذا خاطبهم الجاهلون قالوا سلاما** (and when the ignorant address them, they say, "Peace") – they say **السلام علیکم** (peace be upon you), meaning 'I don't want to talk to you. There's no benefit in talking to you.' When the ignorant address them, it means they don't engage with the ignorant. So, one should not engage with the ignorant. And in the verse from Surah Bani Isra'il which I just presented to you, Allah says:

**ولا تمش فی الارض مرحا**
And do not walk upon the earth exultantly.
- [Reference needed]

Look, when you walk on the earth, do not walk arrogantly. Because if you walk arrogantly, your arrogant walking will neither split the earth nor will you reach the height of the sky or the mountains. Meaning, your height won't become equal to a mountain if you walk arrogantly, so walk moderately. **ولا تمش فی الارض مرحا** (And do not walk upon the earth exultantly). Maraha means walking arrogantly. The Quran commands and forbids, saying: 'Look, do not walk arrogantly. **ولا تمش فی الارض مرحا** (And do not walk upon the earth exultantly).' Why? **انک لن تخرق الارض** (Indeed, you will not tear the earth). Kharaqta means to tear apart. Your walking like that will not tear the earth. No matter how great a person is or how arrogantly they walk, the earth will not tear. And if it does tear, it would be more harmful to them. Nor will they reach the height of a mountain.

Meaning, the Quran is saying here, do not act with arrogance or pride. Rather, one should act with Zuhd (asceticism/abstinence). What does Zuhd (asceticism/abstinence) mean? Zuhd (asceticism/abstinence) means asceticism or what is called 'abstinence' in English. Abstinence means that if Allah is giving something, if Allah is giving a blessing—the meaning for an intelligent person is not to say, 'No, no, Astaghfirullah (I seek forgiveness from Allah), we don't want anything,' if Allah gives a blessing. No, this is a verse from the Quran, a verse from Surah Al-Hadid. If Allah is giving a blessing, one should express gratitude for it. And if Allah has deprived one of something or is taking back a blessing, then one should still be patient and express gratitude for it: **الحمد لله** (All praise is due to Allah).

In every situation, gratitude is for Allah. This is a verse from Surah Al-Hadid:
**لِكَيْلَا تَأْسَوْا عَلَىٰ مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلَا تَفْرَحُوا بِمَا آتَاكُمْ**
So that you may not grieve over what has escaped you nor exult in what He has given you.
- [Reference needed]

What is the sign or symbol of Zuhd (asceticism/abstinence)? **لِكَيْلَا تَأْسَوْا عَلَىٰ مَا فَاتَكُمْ** (So that you may not grieve over what has escaped you). If Allah takes something away from you, if Allah deprives you of something, do not show sorrow over it. Do not lament. 'It's a loss, we're ruined, this happened, that happened.' No, whatever happened, even if it's a very big calamity, still **الحمد لله** (all praise is due to Allah), thank Allah.

A huge loss occurred. **الحمد لله** (All praise is due to Allah). Because we didn't bring anything into this world to begin with, that it would be taken away from us today. And one has to leave only with deeds and belief. Grieve at that time when, God forbid, your belief slips away or your deeds slip away. Because these are the only two things that will be of benefit; nothing else will be of any use. People usually say that a person leaves empty-handed. No, we don't leave empty-handed; we leave with the Wilayah (Guardianship) of Commander of the Faithful.

### 2. The Path to Guidance: Imams, Knowledge, and the Hadith of Thaqalayn

So, the strategy of the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, and his Holy Family, peace be upon them, for dealing with people was this: as I presented to you yesterday, forgiving people should be a habit. Forgiving means there should be no malice or grudges in the heart, no enmity or animosity – 'Oh, he did that to us.' I explained this in detail yesterday; I will not repeat it now.

And the second thing is **و امر بالعرف** (and enjoin what is right) – everything that intellect accepts. Now, let's move to the next step. But before proceeding, it is necessary to present something to you so that there is no intellectual theft. In Persian, they call it **duzd-e ilmi** (intellectual theft), meaning no academic plagiarism.

Therefore, let me mention that all the points regarding Imamate that I am presenting to you are from two references: one is **Abaqat al-Anwar** by Mir Hamid Hussain Hindi, may Allah be pleased with him, and the other is a student of Allama Majlisi who was even earlier than Mir Hamid Hussain. His name was Futuni. Allama Majlisi passed away in 1111 AH. Allama Majlisi [passed away] in 1111 AH, and his student was one of his very profound students.

Futuni, he was an Arab. Allama Majlisi was Iranian. But he came from Jabal Amel, solely for the discipleship of Allama Majlisi, just to study under Allama Majlisi. And he was a student of Allama Majlisi, and after that, he remained in Isfahan; his grave is in Isfahan. Allama Futuni al-Amili is a very profound personality. He wrote a book on Imamate, and the name of that book is **ضياء العلمين في بيان** (The Light of the Two Worlds in the Explanation of) or it is written **تبيان امامة الأئمة المصطفين** (Clarification of the Imamate of the Chosen Imams). This is the name of the book, not a hadith.

Meaning, here scholars are not speaking from estimations but from books. Look at the name of the book: **ضياء العلمين** (The Light of the Two Worlds). Diya' (light) means illumination, light. Al-Alamayn (the two worlds) means two worlds. Which worlds? This world and the hereafter. Meaning, Imamate is that light which will illuminate a person in this world and also in the hereafter. **فی تبیان امامۃ الائمۃ المصطفین** (Clarification of the Imamate of the Chosen Imams) – meaning, he wrote the entire book in 10 volumes. Just his introduction, just the introduction he wrote explaining why he is writing the book, what the reason is, he explained the reason in 100 pages. That is, approximately, as far as my memory serves, from page 11 to page 111, he only wrote why he is writing the book, what its reason is, and what the method or methodology of this book is. He has explained the entire methodology, which is why we are mentioning it, because whatever we have taken from this book, after studying the whole book, some points, of course, are very profound and basically for scholars. We can even say with such a challenge that even today, if any scholar reads it, they can learn thousands of things from it.

If one studies this book... Allama Majlisi's teacher, Allama Futuni, Shaykh Futuni, a very great scholar, a very profound personality. He passed away in 1138 [AH]. On the occasion of Ghadir in 1137 [AH], on the 18th of Dhul Hijjah, he completed this book in 10 volumes. This book is in 10 volumes, and it discusses Imamate very profoundly from every single point. But anyway, it is in Arabic now, so most people cannot study it.

And similarly, regarding **Abaqat al-Anwar**, we have already presented to you that **Abaqat** is a miracle, nothing less than a miracle. And its summary has been translated into Urdu from Persian; it is a summary, not a full translation. It's just a summary. Because what Mir Hamid Hussain wrote in Urdu/Persian—sorry, it was translated into Arabic. The original book is in Persian. So, it was translated into Arabic. That too is not complete; it's a summary done by Ayatollah Milani. And its summary in Urdu was written by Mr. Gopalpuri. So, they have, MashaAllah (as God willed), translated it, but it is a summary, not full.

So, anyway, pray that its translation is ongoing, **الحمد لله** (All praise is due to Allah). The Hadith of Thaqalayn (Two Weighty Things) is in a total of four volumes; three volumes are complete and have been published. So, these scholars have rendered great services. Similarly, Shaykh Mufid wrote a book, **Al-Insaf fi al-Imamah** (Equity in the Imamate), which is a very profound book on the topic of Imamate, and he covered the entire subject of Imamate in it. So, I presented a summary of it to you.

Therefore, among us, all the narrations and hadiths, and all our jurists, hadith scholars, and jurisprudents, what command have they given? They commanded: before giving any command to people, what should you do? Awaken their intellects. Enliven their intellects. This is a phrase from the hadith of Commander of the Faithful: **أثاروا لهم دفائن العقول** (They stirred up for them the hidden treasures of intellects). Meaning, bring out their intellects. Enliven their thoughts. Commander of the Faithful says in the first sermon of Nahj al-Balaghah that Allah sent the prophets so that they might bring forth the intellectual thoughts, the correct thoughts that are buried within their intellects – pay attention to the phrase, correct thoughts – so that they can distinguish between good and bad.

Here, I'll try to speak in very simple language, so that everyone understands. Athara means to bring out something that is buried inside the earth. So, 'Uqul (intellects) means all those intellectual matters are buried within human existence. When we came into this world, all these things became buried. Why? Because we became so busy in this world, busy with everything, that now we are so busy in the world that there is no time to ponder over intellectual matters. No one has the time.

Therefore, the prophets, Imams, and successors, and then those hadith narrators and scholars who follow in the footsteps of the Imams, peace be upon them, their duty is to remind people of all these things so that their intellects awaken, and they can distinguish between good and bad. And how can this happen? There is only one way: to convey the teachings of the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them, to the people. There is no other way. The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, said this many times. You have heard the Hadith of Thaqalayn (Two Weighty Things). The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, mentioned the Hadith of Thaqalayn. Every child should memorize the Hadith of Thaqalayn. This is the Hadith of Thaqalayn for which no one has an answer.

That hadith should be memorized by everyone. And keep repeating it again and again. This is the hadith that the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, repeated many times in his life. The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, kept repeating it at different places. So, never get tired. Yes, never think, 'Oh, he already recited this hadith in the previous gathering.' Yes, if we ask someone, and they say it was recited, we should ask, 'Brother, do you remember it?'

So, the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, said: 'I am leaving among you two weighty things.' Giran-qadr (valuable) means very valuable, two valuable things, two precious things. And what are they? One is the Book of Allah, and the other is my Holy Family, peace be upon them. If you hold firmly to these two, you will never deviate after me. You will never go astray. And these two will never separate from each other until they meet me at the Pond of Kauthar.

And the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, indicated—there are two different types of hadith: in one, the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, indicated like this, and in another, like that. These two will always remain together, they will never separate from each other; the Quran and the Holy Family, peace be upon them, can never be separated from each other. Therefore, if anyone claims that they have the Quran but not the Holy Family, peace be upon them, then they are lying. And if anyone claims that they have the Holy Family, peace be upon them, but are far from the Quran, then they are also lying.

So, both are lying. If someone is close to the Quran, it is necessary that they are also close to the Holy Family, peace be upon them. If they are close to the Holy Family, peace be upon them, it is necessary that they are also close to the Quran.

### 3. The Essence of Worship: Ma'rifat (Recognition) of Allah through the Imams

Now, let's move on. See what a point it is. The Imam says—and this hadith, that is, first, a very famous and well-known hadith—you have heard the verse of the Quran, Surah Adh-Dhariyat:

**و ما خلقت الجن و الانس الا لیعبدون**
And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.
- [Reference needed]

Bearing this verse in mind, Sayyid al-Shuhada (Master of Martyrs) Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, said:
**أيها الناس إن الله جل ذكره**
O people, indeed Allah, Glorious is His remembrance.
- [Reference needed]

O people, Allah, whose remembrance is glorious. It's strange, yes, understand all these things. If we were to explain each word of this, it would require ten nights. Let me explain **إن الله جل ذكره** (Indeed Allah, Glorious is His remembrance) a little bit, alright, so that you don't get too tired; we don't want to tire you, so we'll read quickly. **إن الله جل ذكره** (Indeed Allah, Glorious is His remembrance) – Allah, whose remembrance is glorious. It's not talking about Allah Himself. It's talking about the remembrance of Allah. The remembrance of Allah is Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them.

The angel is a glorious remembrance. **إن الله جل ذكره** (Indeed Allah, Glorious is His remembrance). Now, there's an entire discussion about this in **Bihar al-Anwar** by Allama Majlisi, may Allah be pleased with him. The Imam says:

**نحن ذكر الله**
We are the remembrance of Allah.
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, we are the remembrance of Allah. So, His remembrance is glorious. What would He Himself be, whose remembrance is glorious? SubhanAllah (Glory be to Allah)! **جل ذكره** (Glorious is His remembrance).

**ما خلق العباد الا لیعرفھو**
He did not create the servants except that they know Him.
- [Reference needed]

He did not create the servants except for this: that they know Him. What does Allah say in the Quran? Allah says, 'We created them so they would worship us.' What is Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, saying? 'He created them so they would know Allah.' Now, the point is clear, isn't it? To know Him.

**فَاِذَا عَرَفُوهُ عَبَدُوهُ**
And when they know Him, they worship Him.
- [Reference needed]

Only then will they truly worship Him. Correct worship will only happen after knowledge. If there is no knowledge, worship is zero. I discussed 'zero worship' in the context of the Khawarij. We will not repeat it. **إذا عرفوه عبدوه** (When they know Him, they worship Him) – then there will be true worship, actual worship, which I will present to you shortly, God willing, if I am granted the opportunity.

**فَإِذَا عَبَدُوهُ استغنوا بعبادت من سواه**
And when they truly worship Him with knowledge, they become independent of worshipping anyone else.
- [Reference needed]

Then they will become needless of worshipping everyone else; they will not bow their heads before anyone. Whoever truly knows Allah and then worships Him will never bow their head before anyone else. Why? Because bowing one's head before anyone other than Allah is humiliation. Bowing one's head before Allah is honor. When a person prostrates to Allah, their honor increases. And when they bow their head before others besides Allah, they become humiliated and disgraced.

He becomes humiliated and disgraced. Therefore, Sayyid al-Shuhada, peace be upon him, said:

**إن الدعي ابن الدعي قد تركني بين السلة والذلة، هيها من الذلة**
Indeed, the claimant, son of the claimant, has left me between drawn swords and humiliation. Far be it from humiliation.
- [Reference needed]

Now, what does Ad-da'i (the claimant) mean? It refers to one who was born illegitimately. Da'i ibn ad-da'i (the claimant, son of the claimant) means his father was also born illegitimately. You understand now, right? Both, meaning, father and son, both illegitimate. It's clear, isn't it? These are the phrases of Sayyid al-Shuhada, yes, and they are written in all the chronicles of martyrdom; it's not like we are making this up right now, yes. This is the language of Sayyid al-Shuhada. **إن الدعي ابن الدعي** (Indeed, the claimant, son of the claimant). Now, many of our people think very well that we should be very good. So they say, 'No, he was talking about Ibn Ziyad.' Ibn Ziyad did not demand allegiance. Walid, who demanded allegiance, asked for it for Yazid. Now, you can interpret the rest yourself, alright?

**إن الدعي ابن الدعي قد تركني بين السلة والذلة** (Indeed, the claimant, son of the claimant, has left me between drawn swords and humiliation). He has placed only two options before me: either I draw my sword and stand against him—that is what Sillah (drawn sword) means—or I pledge allegiance to him and accept humiliation and disgrace. **هيهات منا الذلة** (Humiliation is far from us). Humiliation is very far from us. We are not among those who are humiliated and disgraced. **هيهات منا الذلة** (Humiliation is far from us) was the slogan of Sayyid al-Shuhada, peace be upon him. We do not accept humiliation.

So Sayyid al-Shuhada, peace be upon him, says that when a person truly gains knowledge of Allah, they will perform worship correctly, and when they truly speak of Allah after gaining knowledge, they will not bow their head before anyone. So, one person from the people stood up and asked: 'O son of the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, tell us, what is the knowledge of Allah?' The Imam replied:

**معرفة أهل كل زمان إمامهم الذي يجب عليهم طاعته**
The knowledge of the people of every age is their Imam, whose obedience is obligatory upon them.
- [Reference needed]

What is the knowledge of Allah? What is the knowledge of Allah? It is the knowledge of the Imam of the time. Recognize your Imam of the Time, whose obedience is obligatory upon you.

The knowledge of that Imam. Well, the knowledge of the Imam of the time is most important, but the knowledge of all the Imams is obligatory. That is why in a hadith, the Imam said: 'If they forget the first ones, how will they remember the later ones? If someone forgets Commander of the Faithful, how will they remember those who came after him?' Therefore, the knowledge of all Imams is obligatory. But, of course, most importantly, as in a hadith, the Imam says, 'Recognize your Imam of the time.' So, how do we recognize the Imams? How do we recognize the Imams? That is also present in a narration from Usul al-Kafi, where the Imam says, Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him, says:

**قال أمير المؤمنين عليه السلام**
Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, said:
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, my esteemed ancestor, Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, said. Let me also say one more thing here: all the Imams say the same thing, and this is proof of their being upon truth. This is proof of being upon truth, that every Imam will say the same thing; there is no contradiction in their words among themselves. So, the Imam says, Commander of the Faithful said:

**اعرف الله بالله والرسول بالرسالة و أولى الأمر بالأمر بالمعروف والعدل والإحسان**
Know Allah by Allah, the Messenger by his message, and the holders of authority by enjoining what is right, justice, and benevolence.
- [Reference needed]

Know Allah through Allah. Allah through Allah. And **الرسول بالرسالة** (the Messenger by his message) – and know the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, through his message. What message did the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, bring? What message did he bring? Look at that. Become familiar with the Quran. Become familiar with the hadiths of the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family. Gain knowledge. Read the Quran. Read the Quran with meaning. Then read the hadiths of the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family. And after that, read the hadiths of the Holy Prophet's successors. See what the Imam said then? The Imam says: And **أولى الأمر** (the holders of authority) – if you want to recognize the holders of authority, meaning those who came after the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, how will you recognize them? One, through **الأمر بالمعروف** (enjoining what is right). Amr bil Ma'ruf (enjoining what is right).

Is that clear to you? Meaning, commanding those things that are in accordance with intellect, and from which people derive pleasure. And second, with justice. Meaning, whenever the Imam gives a command, he will command justice. What does 'Adl (justice) mean? 'Adl (justice) means **وضع الشیء فی موضعه** (placing a thing in its proper place). Placing everything in its proper place is justice. And what is oppression? **وضع الشیء فی غیر موضعه** (placing a thing in other than its proper place). Not placing something in its proper place is oppression. Listen carefully, this is addressed to the youth. Not placing something in its proper place is oppression. No matter how worn out or old a turban or cap is, no matter how little its value, where is its place? On the head. And no matter how expensive a shoe is, SubhanAllah (Glory be to Allah), where is its place? On the foot. Now, if you understood my point, that's good; otherwise, let me explain a little more. An Imam is an Imam. A follower is a follower. The Imam's place is on the head. The follower's place is at the foot, no matter how great they become.

And if someone does not understand, they should read a little history. A very great companion – it's not appropriate to take names. It's not right to take names, but he was a very great companion. You understand 'great,' don't you? Not in height or width, but some people were made great in name, though they were not truly great. Throughout his life, he showed enmity towards the Commander of the Faithful, enmity towards the Holy Family, peace be upon them, enmity towards everyone. And he had a hand in inciting Qadi Shurayh to issue a fatwa against Imam Hussain, peace be upon him. He said, 'Issue a fatwa. Hussain has rebelled against Yazid, and this is not right.' And he was, MashaAllah (as God willed), a master at fabricating hadiths. He was a master at all this. Anyway, old age came. In old age, he came to whose door? Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi, whom I mentioned earlier. Hajjaj, a pure devil, a Walad al-Zina (illegitimate child), the offspring of adultery, Hajjaj. He came to his door. Who was this? A companion of the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family. And he knocked on the door, to the doorkeeper. 'What is it, brother?' Suddenly, at night, he said he wanted to meet Hajjaj. 'Why meet him?' He said, 'I want to pledge allegiance.' 'Pledge allegiance? Why at this late hour?' 'Yes, I heard from the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family,' he said. Hajjaj was brought. It is written in history, Ibn Abi al-Hadid al-Mu'tazili writes in his commentary on Nahj al-Balaghah that when Hajjaj came, he was told that a companion of the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, had come to meet him. In one hand, he had a goblet, and in the other, a glass of wine. He was holding a jug of wine and a glass and came, completely drunk. He asked, 'What do you want? Why have you come so late at night?' He said, 'I want to pledge allegiance.' 'You could do it tomorrow morning.' He said, 'No, I felt I might not live; I might die.' Hajjaj said, 'Alright. So, I heard a hadith from the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family:

**من مات ولم يعرف إمام زمانه مات ميتة جاهلية**
Whoever dies without knowing the Imam of their time dies the death of ignorance.
- [Reference needed]

That's why I have come to pledge allegiance to you, so I don't die the death of ignorance.' The fate of those who abandon the door of the Holy Family, peace be upon them, is precisely this. Whoever leaves the door of the Holy Family, peace be upon them, will meet this fate. **بالعدل و الاحسان** (with justice and benevolence). And Ihsan (benevolence). Meaning, commanding – if you want to recognize the Imam, recognize him through Ihsan. How does the Imam practice Ihsan? To recognize the holders of authority, there are three means. Look, the hadith mentions three ways: one, Amr bil Ma'ruf (enjoining what is right); two, 'Adl (justice); and three, Ihsan (benevolence). Now these three things are clear to you, aren't they? In the Quran, it says: **خذ العفو وامر بالعرف واعرض عن الجاهلين** (Take to forgiveness, enjoin what is right, and turn away from the ignorant). Here, Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, says to recognize the Imam through Amr bil Ma'ruf (enjoining what is right) – the same as in the Quran – through justice, and through Ihsan, always doing good and kindness to everyone.

See, Ihsan (benevolence) is actually a word that we commonly translate as 'goodness' or 'kindness'. But it is something beyond goodness. The word used for goodness in Arabic is Birr. In Arabic, they call it Birr. Here, in the hadith, the word Birr did not come, but rather the word Ihsan came in the Quran and hadith. For example, in the Quran, what does it say? **وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا** (And to parents, show Ihsan - benevolence). Show Ihsan (benevolence) to your parents. Treat your parents with good conduct. What does that mean? The Quran itself said it. Meaning, Birr (goodness) is good; do good deeds, but rather, do Ihsan (benevolence). That is, if we were to say it in today's terms, to explain to children: there is one thing that makes the other person satisfied; that is goodness, that is Birr. And there is another thing that makes the other person delighted. That is called Ihsan (benevolence). Meaning, treat your parents in such a way that they become delighted.

They should be delighted. Children should treat their parents this way. Is that clear to you? This is the way of the Holy Family, peace be upon them; this is their method. Meaning, children should not think that they are doing a favor to their parents. No, no. Rather, they should think, 'What can we do so that our parents are not just happy with us, but immensely pleased?' Immensely pleased. Just like Wahb Kalbi's mother sent her young son to fight in Karbala. And when he returned, drenched in blood, he asked his mother: **هل رضيت يا أمي؟** (Are you pleased, my mother?) 'Mother, are you pleased now?' So, the mother replied, 'No, I did not send you to come back. I am not pleased with this. Go and be sacrificed for the Imam.' And then what blessing did Allah bestow? That the son was sacrificed, and the mother also became a martyr. Allah granted that woman the status of martyrdom. Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest)! What a blessing Allah gave to a woman who was Christian just a few moments ago and had just embraced Islam. This is called Ihsan (benevolence).

And there are many such examples. God willing, we will present examples to you. So now, if I were to present to you here, what is the way to recognize the Imam? The method is also simple. Publicize as many narrations as possible, publicize as many hadiths as possible. Why? The Imam says: The Imam says:

**لو يعلم الناس محاسن كلامنا لاتبعونا**
If people knew the beauty of our words, they would surely follow us.
- [Reference needed]

This hadith is from Abul-Salt al-Harawi. Abul-Salt al-Harawi was from Herat. Harawi means Herat, and Herat means Afghanistan. And this place, Afghanistan, this region of Herat, was entirely a Shia-dominated area. It still is; most of the majority is there in Herat. And these were people whom others were very apprehensive of. And in the books of scholars from 50-60 years ago that we have read, one reason for this was that these people were very strict about Khums (Islamic tax). They would give a lot of Khums. That is why Allah would also bless their crops and put awe of them in the hearts of their enemies. These are two great benefits of Khums: one is blessings in sustenance, and two is awe in the heart of the enemy. Whoever comes before you, Allah will put your awe in their heart. This is a very powerful aspect of Khums. Look, we don't have any permission, and we don't collect Khums, alright? You might think, 'Oh, look, they started this too.' No, what is in the narrations, what is in the hadiths, that's what we are saying. And what the scholars have said.

So, Abul-Salt al-Harawi says that Imam Reza, peace be upon him, told him. He was one of his special companions. One of his special companions. The Imam told me:

**رحم الله عبدا أحيا أمرنا**
May Allah have mercy on a servant who revives our affair.
- [Reference needed]

May the Lord bestow mercy on that servant who revives our affair. Who revives our affair. This is what we call Ihya-e-Amr (reviving the affair). So, Amr (affair) means affair, matter – to revive the Imamate. The one who revives the Imamate. So, Abul-Salt asked:

**كيف يحيي أمركم يا ابن رسول الله؟**
How is your affair revived, O son of the Messenger of Allah?
- [Reference needed]

How is your affair revived? So, the Imam replied:

**يتعلم علومنا ويحييها للناس**
He learns our sciences and teaches them to the people.
- [Reference needed]

Learn our knowledge, our hadiths, and teach them to the people. Learn the hadiths, teach them to the people. **رحم الله عبده** (May Allah have mercy on His servant) – the Imam prays for him. After that, the Imam says this sentence: **لو يعلم الناس محاسن كلامنا لاتبعونا** (If people knew the beauty of our words, they would surely follow us). If people recognized the beauty of our hadiths, they would surely follow us.

What did we do? We distanced people from hadiths. Look, what is fact is fact. If someone finds it offensive, so be it, but this is the reality. That when it comes to hadith, and these are not actually our sentences; we are just defamed for no reason. These are the sentences of Commander of the Faithful. These are the sentences of Commander of the Faithful. God willing, if Allah grants me the opportunity, tomorrow I will present the entire hadith to you. Commander of the Faithful says that people will be enemies of our hadiths. They will be two-faced towards our hadiths—and he's not talking about others, he's talking about our own people. When you talk about a hadith, they say, 'Oh, do we understand hadiths? Are we Allama Majlisi? Do we understand?' This is wrong. If the Imams narrated hadiths, they narrated them for us, for the people. Did the Imams ever say that only Allama Majlisi or only scholars should read hadiths? No. The Imam said, 'Refer to those who are experts in hadith. Learn our hadiths from them.' Do you know what another problem we have? One problem is that we are very far from the companions of the Imams. We don't even know the companions. And that's why when we mention names, children often come afterwards and say, 'We never heard that name. Whose name did you mention in the gathering?' They don't even know those names. Why? Unfortunately, this is the current situation. There was a companion of the Sixth Imam, whose name was Al-Harith ibn Mughirah. A profound personality. Such a personality that the Imam gave him the glad tidings of Paradise during his lifetime.

### 4. Confronting Injustice: Examples from the Ahlul Bayt (A.S.)

Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, and Imam Hasan, and Imam Hussain, all of them, continued to speak out even after the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. Now, quickly, before you, I will try to present one or two examples, if not, then at least one. The rest, God willing, will be tomorrow.

Look, Imam Hasan and Imam Hussain, peace be upon them. What is the Imam's age now? Barely 15 years, 15 or 16 years. 15 or 16 years old. And those who usurped the right of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him and his holy family, yes, they usurped his right. They were not worthy. They were not eligible. Now, they came and sat on the pulpit, telling people... I mean, look, what did he say while sitting on the pulpit? What sentence did he utter? He said, he uttered this:

**أنا أولى بالمؤمنين من أنفسهم**
I am more deserving of the believers than their own selves.
- [Reference needed]

What did he say? **أنا أولى بالمؤمنين من أنفسهم** (I am more deserving of the believers than their own selves). Meaning, I am the master of the people, and I possess more power and authority over them than they themselves do.

As soon as he said this:

**فقال له الحسين عليه السلام من ناحية المسجد**
So Hussain, peace be upon him, said to him from a corner of the mosque.
- [Reference needed]

Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, was in a corner of the Prophet's Mosque, on one side. From there, he said:

**انزل أيها الكذاب عن منبر أبي رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله**
Get down! O LIAR! From the pulpit of my father, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family.
- [Reference needed]

Get down from the pulpit of my father, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family! We deliberately said "father," yes. We deliberately used the word "father." Get down from the pulpit of my father, the Messenger of Allah! **لا منبر أبيك** (It is not the pulpit of your father). This is not your father's pulpit.

Is that clear? Now, some people say, "This Hadith (Prophetic tradition) cannot be true. The character was not like that." The character WAS like that. Why? Because they were witnessing injustice. What does injustice mean? Something that is not in its proper place. When the Imam sees any kind of injustice, he immediately raises his voice. **لا منبر أبيك** (It is not the pulpit of your father).

The usurper immediately said:

**فَمِنْبَرُ أبيكَ لَعَمْرِي يا حُسَين**
By my life, the pulpit is indeed your father’s, O Hussain.
- [Reference needed]

"It is your father's pulpit." Imam Hussain immediately retorted: **لا منبر أبي** (It is not my father's pulpit). "What is my father's? It's not my father's pulpit." This is what happens immediately. This is what happens to an oppressor; when an oppressor is challenged, he immediately retreats. But the condition is that they must be challenged continuously, spoken to continuously. If people remain silent, thinking "What does it have to do with us?" – and the Ummah (community) did exactly that, didn't they? The Ummah remained silent. The Ummah did exactly that, my brother. God willing, we will explain it.

So then he asked him:

**من علمك هذا**
Who taught you this?
- [Reference needed]

"Who sent you, having taught you this? Your father, Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him and his holy family? Did your father, Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him and his holy family, teach you and send you?"

**فقال الحسين عليه السلام**
So Hussain, peace be upon him, said.
- [Reference needed]

Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, said:

**إن أطع أبي في ما أمرني**
If I obey my father in what he commanded me.
- [Reference needed]

"If I obey my father, in his command, then by my life, by my life, Commander of the Faithful is the guide, and I am his follower." Commander of the Faithful is the guide, I am his follower.

**ولو في رقاب الناس البيعة**
Even if the allegiance is on the necks of the people.
- [Reference needed]

And people pledged allegiance on his hands. Their allegiance is around the necks of the people, around the necks of the people.

During the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, when Jibrail (Gabriel) descended with this verse, saying:

**يا أيها الرسول بلغ**
O Messenger, convey!
- [Reference needed]

Then no one can deny this allegiance, the allegiance to the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him and his holy family, except for one who denies the Qur'an. The Qur'an and the Commander of the Faithful are together. Whoever denied the Commander of the Faithful has denied the Qur'an.

Just now, I was listening to a statement from a mullah, may a curse be upon that mullah! He was saying that if anyone considers the Ahlul Bayt (People of the Household) superior to the Companions (Sahaba), he does not consider them Muslim. We tell him, "O mullah, WE don't consider YOU a Muslim!" So you won't consider him a Muslim? This is our answer to that mullah. He made that statement just now.

Now think, but what is the problem? That we are silent. No, no, not silent. Such a mullah must be answered! And we should answer him boldly! "What, brother, you won't consider him a Muslim? WE don't consider YOU a Muslim!" Simply by having a long beard and the rest of the appearance, as you know, is that clear? Nobody becomes a Muslim just by that. A Muslim is one who obeys Allah in the manner that is His due of obedience. His due of obedience. One who obeys the Messenger, peace be upon him and his holy family. How? That's it, we will conclude this Hadith here.

So the Master of Martyrs (Imam Hussain, peace be upon him) said that:

**قد عرفها الناس بقلوبهم**
People recognized it in their hearts.
- [Reference needed]

Meaning people recognized the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him and his holy family, with their hearts, but:

**و أنكروها بألسنتهم**
And they denied it with their tongues.
- [Reference needed]

But they denied it with their tongues. They denied it with their tongues. They denied the Commander of the Faithful. They recognized that he was on the truth. They knew. Everyone knew what was right and what was wrong. But they were following the wrong. They were abandoning the truth and following Batil (falsehood), even though they knew it was falsehood, they knew it was wrong. Yet, they remained silent. A pigeon was sitting on their heads. No one came to help the Commander of the Faithful. The Commander of the Faithful was alone. There were only a few people, who could be counted on fingers. Many great and renowned Companions (Sahaba), whom you have heard about, God willing, will be mentioned again.

### 5. Anas ibn al-Harith: A Companion's Enduring Loyalty

There was a Companion (Sahabi) who was among the very first martyrs (Shuhada) of Karbala. And what was his name? **أنس بن الحارث** (Anas ibn al-Harith). **أنس بن الحارث الكاهلي الأسدي** (Anas ibn al-Harith al-Kahili al-Asadi). He was from Banu Asad. **أنس بن الكاهلي** (Anas ibn al-Kahili).

Look, what is the level of submission? He is a Companion (Sahabi) of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family; he is a servant of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. When he was young, he was a servant of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, departed from this world, becoming a martyr. Anas served the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him. When the Commander of the Faithful was martyred, Anas served Imam Hasan Mujtaba, peace be upon him. Anas continued to serve until 50 Hijri. **أنس بن الحارث الكاهلي الأسدي** (Anas ibn al-Harith al-Kahili al-Asadi).

Great scholars, the scholars of Ahl-e-Tasannun (Sunni scholars), Bukhari himself wrote it in his book, it is written in Sahih Bukhari. It is written. The name is written. **أنس بن الحارث الكاهلي الأسدي** (Anas ibn al-Harith al-Kahili al-Asadi). **من الصحابة** (Among the Companions). A Companion of the Messenger. **قتل مع الحسين** (Martyred with Hussain). He was martyred with Hussain. Just imagine, he was martyred with Hussain. It doesn't say who martyred him. It doesn't say who martyred him, and whether the one who martyred him was a Muslim or not. Those who killed Hussain, those who killed Hussain's companions, were they Muslims or not? Isn't that a question, brother?

Are you listening? You listen very calmly. Ah, you listen calmly, because we've also recited this before Punjabis, haven't we? That's why we know how they listen if we were to recite this there.

**أنس بن كاهل أسدي** (Anas ibn Kahil Asadi). If Bukhari is writing that this person martyred him, Ibn Abi Hatim is writing this. Ibn Abi Hatim is writing it in his book. This scholar is from the 4th century Hijri, 353. Bukhari is from the 3rd century. He's writing this. Now, look, he's writing it OPENLY. Now, if those who killed Hussain were Muslims, then it means that even if you speak ill of the Companions, you will still remain a Muslim. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow! Wow, wow! Is that clear or not? So then what is OUR fault?

Anyway, by the 5th – sorry, by 50 Hijri – he had become very old. And he was so old that he was no longer fit for any work. So he said, "Okay, I don't know when my death will come. That's why I am going to Karbala." In 50 Hijri, Karbala was completely deserted. There was nothing in Karbala. There was no one. It was a desert, a complete desert. And searching for Karbala, he reached it and pitched his tent there. In the middle of the desert. And he pitched his tent and sat alone. We don't know where his sustenance was coming from. Wow, wow, wow, wow, SubhanAllah (Glory be to Allah), wow, wow!

We don't know, but it is written in history, it is written in history, that from 50 Hijri to 61 Hijri, for 11 years, Anas ibn Harith al-Kahili al-Asadi was alone in the desert of Karbala, until the caravan of Hussain, peace be upon him, arrived on the 2nd of Muharram.

Before that, people came, it is also written in history, they came and asked. When they saw the tent in the desert, they asked, "Old man, what are you doing here?" Alone, solitary in the desert, you will die of hunger and thirst. There is no one here. Not a single human or Jinn (genie) for miles around. He said, "I heard from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, that my grandson will be killed in Karbala. I wish to either die before that, or if I remain alive, then die helping Hussain, peace be upon him." For the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, said: "Whoever helps Hussain, peace be upon him, has helped me. He has helped me." Allah kept Anas ibn Kahir alive in that desert for 11 years. For 11 years, until Hussain, peace be upon him, arrived, and Anas met him. Both embraced. Anas remained with him until when? Until the morning of Ashura. The very first discussion that took place on the morning of Ashura, the very first exchange, was that of Anas ibn Kahir with Umar ibn Sa'd, may Allah curse him. Yes, that was Anas ibn Kahil's discussion.

Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, and Anas ibn... while they write this. Anas was so old, wasn't he? His eyes were completely white, he was in such a state. So Sa'd came; Sa'd knew that I, for whom you must read by love for Haritha... with permission... and taking the elderly... until Ashura. O Shi'a of Allah... the Ummah of Humam Shah Al and his glory... and Shah Hussain... we have water. In the river. In Ziyarat al-Nahiyah (salutation from the spiritual side).

So, for someone who is a Companion (Sahabi) of the Messenger, peace be upon him and his holy family, and a Companion of an Imam, just imagine the fervor for martyrdom (Shahadat) in him! Oh, what fervor for martyrdom must be there in someone who is a result of the prayers of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him and his holy family! Just imagine what kind of fervor it would be. And to kill this fervor, to extinguish this spirit – THAT was the real bravery, the real courage.

### 6. The Sacrifice of Abbas (A.S.)

Ah, O mourners! This is what Abbas ibn Ali calls it. He who killed this fervor is called Abbas ibn Ali. That Abbas, who continuously sought permission, but Hussain, peace be upon him, kept refusing. Until, on Ashura, that moment also came when Hazrat Abbas, peace be upon him, came again. Mir Anis says: "He, the man of honor, did not ask for permission, for he was great." He, the man of honor, did not ask for permission, for he was great. Hazrat Abbas, peace be upon him, came and simply stood before Hussain, peace be upon him. Hussain understood why Abbas had come, so he said, "Abbas, go and bring water for the children."

The children are thirsty. The Master came to the tent's entrance and called out for Sakina. As soon as the little girl heard the call, she came running, and asked, "Uncle, how did you remember, my child? Bring your water-skin!" She said, "Uncle, what will we do with the water-skin?" He said, "The Master has commanded me to bring water. I should bring water. The Master has commanded me to bring water." Sakina went and was walking with the water-skin. It is written in the accounts of martyrdom (Maqtal) that as soon as Sakina started walking with the water-skin, little children were walking with Sakina. They asked, "Lady, where is this water-skin going?" She said, "My uncle is going to fetch water. Children, now be assured." "Father has told uncle to bring water. Now my uncle will surely bring water. Now you can be at peace." Sakina greatly reassured the children, and the children also became very confident. Sakina brought the water-skin and gave it to Abbas. Abbas set off. Now, listen to the words from the account of martyrdom (Maqtal).

Abbas came. He came to the bank of the Euphrates. He pushed back the armies, and the armies themselves kept moving away. Once, Abbas, Abbas put his horse into the river. He put his horse into the river, dismounted from the horse, took water in his cupped hand, and said, "O villains! O oppressors! Do not think that I am helpless. I can drink water. I can take water. But what can I do?" "The children in the tent are thirsty. Sakina in the tent is thirsty." Saying this, he threw the water away. After throwing the water, Abbas soaked the water-skin, filled it with water, and then mounted his horse again.

Now, as he started moving towards the tents, Abbas had only one goal and one purpose, one aim: that somehow, water MUST reach the tents. Now, as Abbas started to move, as soon as he began walking, an arrow of tyranny (tir-e sitam) struck the water-skin. Water began to flow from the water-skin. As the water began to flow, Abbas lowered his head. He turned the horse around. "Now, what will I do by going towards the tents? What will I do by going into the tents now?" It is written in the accounts of martyrdom (Maqtal) that as soon as Abbas lowered his head, a villain (Shaqi) came from behind and struck Abbas's head with full force using an iron mace (gurz-e aahan), an iron mace, a mace of iron. Abbas fell from the back of the horse (pusht-e faras) onto the land of Karbala (arz-e Karbala).

O mourners! See, it is a natural thing, an innate thing, that when a person falls from a height, their hands come forward first. But alas, Abbas, the Standard Bearer (Alamdar), had no hands! He fell face down. He landed on the land of Karbala and called out, "Master, come for help!" As soon as the sound reached Hussain's ears, Hussain held his back. He recited an elegy (Marsiya):

**الآن انكسر ظهری**
Now my back is broken.
- [Reference needed]

Now my back is broken. Now my back is broken.

**وقلت حیلتی**
And my means are few.
- [Reference needed]

Abbas, now nothing is visible, nothing can be discerned.

**و شمات بي عدوي**
And my enemy rejoices at my misfortune.
- [Reference needed]

Abbas, the enemy is taunting. "What happened to your Standard Bearer? Your Standard Bearer, of whom you were so proud, has been killed." He reached Abbas's side, arrived in the lowland, and reaching the bank of the Euphrates, he placed Abbas's head on his lap. Brother and brother spoke for a while. Abbas made a will. Among the clauses of his will was that his body, his body, should NOT be taken to the tents.

Now, while they were conversing, suddenly Abbas's eyes closed. As soon as Abbas's eyes closed, Hussain recited another elegy (Marsiya):

**اليوم نهب**
Today is plunder.
- [Reference needed]

Abbas, with your passing, those eyes that used to sleep will now awaken. Those wives, those children, who used to sleep peacefully because of you, will now awaken. NOW the villains will sleep. Hussain bade farewell to Abbas while reciting the elegy. Wa Hussainah! Wa Abbasah! (Oh Hussain! Oh Abbas!).
