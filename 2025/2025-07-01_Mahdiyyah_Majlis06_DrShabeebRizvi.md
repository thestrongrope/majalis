### The Lament of Ruqayyah (AS) and Lady Zainab (AS)

The lecture begins with a lament reflecting the sorrowful dialogues and conditions of Imam Husain's daughter, Ruqayyah (AS), and Lady Zainab (AS) after the tragedy of Karbala.

The lament of Ruqayyah (AS):
"It's a ruse, a ruse, a ruse, a ruse. Oh father, will you come to put me to sleep? Will you come to show your face every day?"
Shabbir (Imam Husain) said, "O light of my eyes, you now have to travel until evening. The people of the city will now make you a prisoner."
The princess said, "I have no fear. Just tell me, will you come to put me to sleep? Will you come to show your face every day? Oh father, will you come to put me to sleep? Will you come to show your face every day? Will you come to spread my bedding? Will you come to show your face every day? Oh father, will you come to put me to sleep? Will you come to show your face every day?"
Mustafa (the Prophet Muhammad) said to her heart, "O Shahin, there is no more peace for you in your destiny, daughter. Now you will be slapped by the accursed Shimr."
Hearing this, the grieving girl said, "Will you come to save me from Shimr? Will you come to show your face every day? Oh father, will you come to put me to sleep? Will you come to show your face every day?"
Then the king taught his daughter something, "Your hands will also be tied with ropes."
Hearing this, the distressed girl said, "Will you come to embrace me? Will you come to show your face every day? Oh father, will you come to put me to sleep? Will you come to show your face every day?"
Weeping, Shabbir kissed her and said, "Your cheeks will also be wounded. The days of your weeping have come, princess."
She said, "How will I see you weeping? Will you come to console me? Will you come to show your face every day? Oh father, will you come to put me to sleep? Will you come to show your face every day? Will you come to make me bread in the house? Will you come to show your face every day? Oh father, will you come to put me to sleep? Will you come to show your face every day? Will you come to lift my body? Will you come to show your face every day? Oh father, will you come to put me to sleep? Will you come to show your face every day?"

The lament of Lady Zainab (AS) as a prisoner:
The family of Imran said and the prisoner said, "O sisters, when I was taken captive, you did not come, O Ghazi. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling, but you did not come, O Ghazi. The evening has come, the camp has been looted, the family of the pure has been looted. Walking on the sand, the standard has become cold. To offer condolences, to meet me, my father Ali came, but you did not come, O Ghazi. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling, but you did not come, O Ghazi. In the heat, I was with you, Abbas, until home. O brother, my head... don't you know? O standard-bearer of loyalty, this sister, by God, from you... you did not come. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling, but you did not come. What can I say, my lion, they took my veil, these Muslims, from city to city. Sometimes the people of Kufa, sometimes the people of Sham, you did not come, O Ghazi. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling."

### Introduction: The Essence of Worship and Gnosis

The speaker begins by seeking refuge in Allah and invoking His names, followed by praise for Allah and blessings upon the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and his pure family). A special mention is made for the Imam of our time, Imam Mahdi (AS), and Imam Husain (AS).

#### The Hadith of Imam Husain (AS)

The lecture centers around a noble Hadith narrated from our master Imam Husain ibn Ali (AS):
من عبد اللہ حق عبادتہ، آتاہ اللہ فوق امانیہ و کفایتہ
_Whoever worships Allah as He deserves to be worshipped, Allah will grant him more than his wishes and suffice him in his needs._
- [Reference needed]

#### Gnosis (Ma'rifat) as a Prerequisite for Worship

The speaker emphasizes that the condition for receiving Allah's bounties, as mentioned in the Hadith, is to perform worship that is the "right of worship." This true worship, it is stressed, is not possible without Gnosis (Ma'rifat). Without Gnosis, worship yields no result; it becomes null and void. Thus, Gnosis is paramount.

#### The Importance of Knowing the Imam of Our Time

The Master of Martyrs himself highlights the critical importance of Gnosis. Here, Gnosis specifically refers to the Gnosis of one's Imam of the time. It is crucial to recognize the Imam of our time and, more broadly, the station of Imamate itself.

Yesterday, it was mentioned that the Gnosis of Allah is inherently the Gnosis of the Imam. This is because the Imam serves as the guide, showing the correct path, introducing accurate beliefs, and teaching the proper method of worship. If the Imam is not divinely appointed (Manṣūṣ min Allāh) and one does not seek guidance from him, then neither beliefs nor actions, including prayer and fasting, will be correct. Therefore, recognizing the goal, position, and reality of Imamate is essential.

### The Transcendence of Imamate Beyond Human Intellect

It is impossible for a person to truly recognize the Imam by merely relying on their own intellect to comprehend the reality of Imamate. Imamate is beyond human intellectual grasp.

#### Statements of Amir al-Mu'minin (AS) and Imam Reza (AS)

The Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS), states in the Sermon of Shiqshiqiyyah:
"From my being, a river of knowledge is flowing. A sea of knowledge is flowing from my being. And the bird of intellect, no matter how high it flies, can never reach me."
- [Reference needed - Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 3 (Shiqshiqiyyah)]

Imam Reza (AS) similarly states:
"The value and status of Imamate is greater than that, its glory is more magnificent than that, the depth of its Imamate is greater than that, that people can reach Imamate through their intellects or comprehend its reality, to understand it."
- [Reference needed]

#### The Divine Nature of Gnosis

Since human intellect cannot comprehend the reality of the Imam and Imamate, the question arises: how can a person recognize the Imam? The answer is that just as a person cannot understand the reality of Allah until Allah introduces Himself, similarly, a person cannot recognize the reality of the Imam until the Imam introduces himself. Until the Imam speaks about Imamate, it is impossible for people to understand what an Imam is and what Imamate entails. If they cannot understand the reality of the Imam and Imamate with their intellects, how can they choose an Imam?

No one can recognize Allah until Allah introduces Himself. A narrator once asked an Imam, "Do people have the ability to reach Gnosis, to perceive Gnosis? Do they have the ability, the capacity?" The Imam replied, "No, this is from Allah. Whomever Allah gives Gnosis, he will get Gnosis. Gnosis is only an act of the Lord God. People have no say in it."

If one questions the Hadith that says "acquire Gnosis," the answer lies in two important meanings:
1.  When Allah introduces Himself and makes Himself known, the servant should accept it.
2.  Providing the premises and preliminaries of this Gnosis is the servant's responsibility.

#### The Role of the Prophet (SAW) in Guiding to Allah

Who will teach this Gnosis? The Prophet will teach it. How do we recognize the Prophet? We recognize him through reason. The Prophet is the one who leads to Allah. Therefore, when a person acts upon what the Prophet has commanded, he will reach Allah.

The Quran states:
وَمَنْ يُطِعِ الرَّسُولَ فَقَدْ أَطَاعَ اللَّهَ
_Whoever obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah._
- [Surah An-Nisa, 4:80]

#### Imamate as the Source of Life

In another verse, the Quran states:
يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اسْتَجِيبُوا لِلَّهِ وَلِلرَّسُولِ إِذَا دَعَاكُمْ لِمَا يُحْيِيكُمْ
_O you who have faith, when Allah and His Messenger call you, respond to the call of Allah and His Messenger to that which gives you life._
- [Surah Al-Anfal, 8:24]

The verse uses the singular "when *he* calls you," referring to the Messenger, because Allah does not call directly; the Messenger calls. The Messenger gives you life if you respond to his call. Without responding to the Messenger's call, a person may have apparent breath, but he will not be a true human being; he will be spiritually dead, merely living an apparent life.

When the narrator asked the Imam, "What is that thing to which Allah and His Messenger invite and through which life is given?" The Imam said, "Life is given through our Wilayat (guardianship). Through our Wilayat." This illustrates the elevated position of Imamate, which is beyond the intellect of ordinary people.

Similarly, only when the Imam introduces himself can people truly understand what Imamate is. This understanding comes when people follow the divinely appointed Imam (Manṣūṣ min Allāh).

### Refuting Human Selection of the Imam

#### Dialogue with Imam Zaman (AS)

Sa'd ibn Abdullah al-Qummi, a special companion of the eleventh Imam, once traveled to Samarra to meet the Imam. He sought answers to questions posed by opponents, particularly regarding the human right to select an Imam. Upon reaching, he found Imam Zaman (may Allah hasten his noble reappearance) in the lap of Imam Hasan al-Askari (AS), a small child.

Imam Hasan al-Askari (AS) instructed Sa'd to ask his questions to his son, the Imam of his time. Sa'd then asked the child Imam: "Why have people not been given the right to select their own Imam?" This question arises because opponents claim that after the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family) departed, he left the religion in the hands of the people to select whomever they wished, which raises questions about the nature of such a religion.

The Imam responded: "Alright, tell me, who is to be selected? A reformer (Muṣliḥ) or a corruptor (Mufsid)? A good person or a bad person? Who is to be selected for the Imamate?" Sa'd replied, "Obviously, a reformer, a good person is to be selected." The Imam then posed several similar questions. The point is that no one truly knows what is in anyone's heart. A person's outward appearance can be deceptive.

An example is given of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (may Allah curse him), who was known for his piety, praying, fasting, and reciting the Quran, even in the Kaaba. Yet, upon receiving news of his caliphate, he closed the Quran and declared, "This is the parting between me and you (هذا فراق بيني وبينك). Now we will meet on the Day of Judgment. I have received what I had to receive." This illustrates that no one knows the true condition of another's heart.

#### Definition of an Imam

One definition of Imamate is that the Imam is the one who is "the most intelligent in childhood and the most knowledgeable when he grows up." This means that even in childhood, the Imam possesses abundant knowledge and intellect; he is born as an Imam and does not acquire knowledge from anyone in the world.

### The Multifaceted Role of Imamate

Imam Reza (AS) elucidates the role of Imamate:

#### Imamate as the Rein of Religion and System of Muslims

ان الامامة زمام الدین
_Indeed, the Imamate is the rein of the religion._
- [Reference needed]

Imamate is the reins or the steering wheel of religion. Without Imamate, religion cannot be guided. Just as a horse without reins or a car without a steering wheel will inevitably crash, leading to destruction, religion without Imamate will devolve into chaos and end. The Imam provides direction and guidance to religion. The existence of religion without Imamate is impossible.

This is why, in Ghadir, it was declared that Allah is pleased with that religion in which Ghadir exists; otherwise, it is not a true religion. It is specifically the Imamate of Ghadir that defines the true religion.

نظام المسلمین
_The system of the Muslims._
- [Reference needed]

Imamate is the system of the Muslims. Without Imamate, there will be complete disorder and chaos among Muslims. Today, people complain about the disunity of Muslims, but these complaints are futile. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family) prophesied that after him, there would be 73 sects, indicating they can never be truly united without the true path.

#### Unity Through Wilayat

The Quran provides the only way to unity:
وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا
_And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided._
- [Surah Al-Imran, 3:103]

The strong rope of Allah (Ḥablullāh al-Matīn) is the Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS).

يا علي، الصراط المستقيم
_O Ali, the straight path._
- [Reference needed]

The Quran states:
وَمَنْ يَعْتَصِم بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ هُدِيَ إِلَى صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ
_Whoever holds firmly to Allah, he will be guided to a straight path._
- [Surah Al-Imran, 3:101]

The phrase "whoever holds firmly to Allah" means to hold tightly. Some modern interpretations of this verse suggest it means holding firmly to the Quran.

#### The Quran as Proof: The Debate of Hisham ibn al-Hakam

Hisham ibn al-Hakam, a profound scholar and companion of Imam Sadiq (AS), once debated a Syrian man who had come to challenge Imam Sadiq (AS) on the topic of Imamate. Hisham, though young (around 16-18 years old), was deep in knowledge, belief, and piety. Imam Sadiq (AS) instructed Hisham to debate the Syrian first.

Hisham asked the Syrian, "Who is the proof (Ḥujjah) after the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family)?" The Syrian replied, "The Quran." Hisham then asked, "If the Quran is the proof, does that mean there is no dispute about the Quran among Muslims?" The Syrian admitted there was dispute. Hisham then retorted, "Then why have you come from Syria to debate with me? You also believe in the same Quran, I also believe in the same Quran. Then why have you come to debate?" The Syrian had no answer.

This shows that the Quran alone cannot be the sole proof. As another Hadith states, "The Quran needs a guardian (Qayyīm)." A Qayyim is one who is aware of the Quran's revelation, its interpretation, its exegesis, and all its knowledge. Hisham explained that if such a Qayyim exists, holding firmly to him will lead to guidance. Without holding firmly to him, guidance will not be found.

When the Syrian disrespectfully asked who this guardian was, Hisham stated, "This is the son of the Messenger." Upon the Syrian's declaration, "We do not believe in him," Hisham trembled with anger. The speaker points out that this is a lesson that we should not be lenient when the Imam or Lady Zahra (AS) are insulted. Hisham then told the Syrian to ask Imam Sadiq (AS) whatever he wished. Imam Sadiq (AS) then began to narrate the Syrian's entire journey, including specific details of his stops and what transpired, thereby demonstrating the knowledge of the unseen (ʿIlm al-Ghayb) possessed by the Imams.

#### Imamate for Worldly Betterment and Believers' Honor

صلاح الدنیا
_For the betterment of the world._
- [Reference needed]

The guidance of Imamate is also necessary for worldly betterment. If one follows the Imam's directions, even in worldly matters, their world will be built. Unfortunately, people have completely abandoned the Imams and their Hadiths, leading to deviations in thought and practice. The Imams have given guidance in every small and big matter, including business and trade. They specifically encouraged their Shias to pursue "Ma'āli al-Umūr" (high matters), meaning big tasks and trades, and leave small ones. This guidance, however, is often overlooked due to our distance from their teachings.

عز المؤمنین
_The honor of the believers._
- [Reference needed]

Whoever holds fast to his Imam will attain honor. "Whoever holds firmly to Allah will be guided to the straight path (ومن یعتصم باللہ فقد ھدی الی صراط مستقیم)." This "holding fast to Allah" means holding fast to the guardianship (Wilayat) of Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS). When one firmly adheres to the Wilayat of Ali ibn Abi Talib and the infallible Imams, they will be honored.

The Quran promises:
وَقَذَفَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الرُّعْبَ
_And He (Allah) cast terror into their hearts concerning you._
- [Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:26 or Surah Al-Hashr, 59:2]

This terror will be cast into the hearts of their enemies when believers hold fast to the Ahlulbayt. Closeness to the Ahlulbayt means adherence to their Hadiths, teachings, and narrations. This is the essence of holding fast. When a person holds fast, reads, and understands the teachings of the Ahlulbayt, they will comprehend the true meaning of Wilayat, mourning (Azadari), and the importance of gatherings (Majalis) and lamentations (Matam). If the organizers and participants of a Majlis act with sincerity, it is impossible for the Ahlulbayt not to attend that gathering.

### The Ahlulbayt: Path to Allah's Pleasure

#### The Betrayal of the Ahlulbayt

People abandoned the Ahlulbayt soon after the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family). Lady Zahra (AS), the daughter of the Messenger, had to go to court and deliver a sermon, which was a 14-page address.

#### Lady Zahra's (AS) Sermon and Prophecy

After delivering the sermon, Lady Zahra (AS) states:
وقد قلت ما قلت، على معرفة مني
_I have said what I had to say. I know._
- [Reference needed - Sermon of Fadak]

She then reveals a profound insight: "I know that your nature, the clay from which you are made, it is in it that you will leave us. This is your clay. Your creation is such that you will leave us. That is, you have decided to leave us, right? This is because of your creation. Your nature is made like that."

She continues, addressing their betrayal: "And that betrayal which has become your motto, what has become the motto of your souls? What has become the slogan of your souls? Betrayal. Betrayal of the Ahlulbayt. The Muslims betrayed the Ahlulbayt. And they are still doing it today." She illustrates this by pointing out how those who cursed Ali (AS) have their Hadiths narrated, while the Hadiths of Imam Sadiq (AS) and other Shias are ignored, labeled as "Rafidis." This is indeed betrayal.

Lady Zahra (AS) then expresses her relief: "But I had to say what was in my heart, I said it. And I have vented my anger. And my passion has now weakened." She indicates that she had to lighten her heart and complete the argument against them, nothing more. "Now you know, and your deeds know. Whatever your condition is, you know, and your deeds know. And this sin that you have committed, it will remain on your back. It will be on your back." This means the sin will not only remain with them but will affect future generations.

She further describes their state:
نقبۃ الخلف
_The hole in the sock._
- [Reference needed]

"Holes have appeared in your socks and in your feet. This is a sign of your poverty." This is a metaphor for their spiritual and moral destitution.

باقیۃ العار، موسومۃ بغضب اللہ (or الجبار)، وأبد الآبدین
_The remaining disgrace, marked with the wrath of Allah (or the Almighty), and forever._
- [Reference needed - Sermon of Fadak]

"Now you will always have to remain only disgraced and humiliated. Marked with the wrath of Allah (or the Almighty)." This signifies that the seal of Allah's wrath has been stamped upon their foreheads, meaning Allah's punishment will descend upon them until the Day of Judgment, and even in Hell, for having abandoned and betrayed the Ahlulbayt. "Now for you, there is nothing but disgrace and humiliation. And what will be its result? Death. Until you reach that fire that reaches the chests." This alludes to a Quranic verse.

Finally, Lady Zahra (AS) concludes with a powerful statement:
فَعَلَى عَيْنِ اللَّهِ تَفْعَلُونَ
_In the sight of Allah, you will be taken (or you are doing this)._
- [Reference needed - Sermon of Fadak]

This emphasizes that their actions against Ali (AS), the "Eye of Allah," are being committed under Allah's watchful gaze.

وَسَيَعْلَمُ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا أَيَّ مُنْقَلَبٍ يَنْقَلِبُونَ
_And soon the wrongdoers will know what their end will be, to which side they will turn._
- [Surah Ash-Shu'ara, 26:227]

They think that by usurping the rights of the Ahlulbayt and betraying them, they have gained worldly power, government, or luxury. But in reality, it is nothing compared to the divine retribution awaiting them.

#### Imamate as the Path to the Lord

Imamate is described as the "path of the Lord" (Sabīl al-Rabb). It is the only way to reach Allah.

The Quran, in Surah Furqan, verse 57, states:
قُلْ مَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ إِلَّا مَن شَاءَ أَن يَتَّخِذَ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِ سَبِيلًا
_Say, O Prophet, say to them, "Say, for the 23 years of hard work that I have done, for the message that I have delivered, I do not want any reward for it, no reward. I do not want any salary for it, no wages, no reward. I do not want anything. Except that whoever wants to take the path that is towards his Lord, he should take that path."_
- [Surah Al-Furqan, 25:57]

This verse, along with another (Surah Ash-Shura, 42:23), indicates that the reward for the message is loving the Ahlulbayt.
قُل لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ
_O Prophet, say to them that I do not want any reward from you for the message, only love my Ahlulbayt._
- [Surah Ash-Shura, 42:23]

As mentioned in Dua Nudba, narrated from Imam Zaman (may Allah hasten his noble reappearance):
_The path to You, O Allah, who is it? The Ahlulbayt._
- [Dua Nudba]

There is no other path; the truth lies solely with the Ahlulbayt. The Quran states:
فَمَاذَا بَعْدَ الْحَقِّ إِلَّا الضَّلَالُ
_After the truth, there is nothing but error._
- [Surah Yunus, 10:32]

Therefore, one must hold firmly to the Ahlulbayt. The Ahlulbayt are the way to reach the pleasure of Allah because they had already acquired it.

#### Ali (AS) Buys Allah's Pleasure

The Quran says:
وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِي نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَاءَ مَرْضَاتِ اللَّهِ
_And among the people is he who sells his soul seeking the pleasure of Allah._
- [Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:207]

This verse refers to the Commander of the Faithful, Ali (AS), who, by sleeping peacefully on the bed of the Messenger, made an unparalleled deal: he sold his own self to buy Allah's pleasure.

#### The Incident of Laylat al-Mabit (Night of Migration)

During the night of migration (Laylat al-Mabit), Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS) slept on the Prophet's bed. He only asked one question: "O Messenger of Allah, will my lying down save your life?" When the Prophet confirmed, Ali responded, "Your life is saved, that is enough for me." He then slept profoundly.

It is remarkable that 40 men, influenced by Satan's whisper to attack together to avoid retaliation from Banu Hashim, surrounded the house and observed Ali (AS) sleeping. They believed it was the Prophet. This demonstrates Ali's bravery, as he faced the enemy both awake and asleep, confronting them directly. Ali (AS) thus sold his self and bought the pleasure of Allah. The Ahlulbayt became the owners of this pleasure, a fact undeniable from this Quranic verse.

The speaker contrasts this with accounts of others who accompanied the Prophet during the migration. In the cave, upon hearing noises, some began to cry, prompting the Prophet to silence them and leading to the revelation of the verse:
لَا تَحْزَنْ
_Do not grieve._
- [Surah At-Tawbah, 9:40]

The singular form "La Tahzan" indicates that only one person was crying. Similarly, the descent of tranquility (Sakinah) was for one person.

### The Significance of Mourning (Azadari)

Imam Baqir (AS) and Imam Sadiq (AS) both narrate:
صل على محمد وآل محمد. نحن اهل البيت، لا يقبل الله عمل عبد، لا يقبل عملا في ذاك الوقت، أبدا، إذا شك فينا.
_We are the Ahlulbayt. Allah will not accept the deed of that servant, He will not accept any deed at that time, none at all, if he doubts about us._
- [Reference needed]

This Hadith emphasizes that doubt about the Ahlulbayt renders all deeds unacceptable.

#### The Revival of the Ahlulbayt's Cause

This mourning (Azadari), lamentation, and weeping are the means by which the cause of the Ahlulbayt is kept alive. The revival of their cause is through this mourning, which is of utmost importance. The speaker intends to elaborate on what one should *not* do when organizing mourning, if Allah wills.

The speaker notes that as Muharram approaches, objections against mourning arise, often from within the Muslim community itself. These objections question the extensive spending on mourning or argue that mourning should only involve prayer and not lamentation or gatherings. The speaker promises to address these objections in future lectures, but emphasizes a key point:

#### Understanding Karbala Through Gnosis

If someone truly comprehends the status and position of the Ahlulbayt, even partially, if they grasp the importance of Imamate and Wilayat, and if they have even a "scent of Gnosis" or a "fragrance of guardianship," they will understand what this mourning means. Such a person would never raise objections against it. They would then comprehend the true nature of Karbala.

The speaker reiterates that no one can fully understand Karbala except the infallible Imams (AS). The reality of Karbala transcends this physical world, existing in the world of particles (ʿĀlam al-Dharr), the world of lights (ʿĀlam al-Anwār), the world of forms (ʿĀlam al-Ashbāḥ), and the world of souls (ʿĀlam al-Arwāḥ) – that is, in the worlds preceding this one. Even today, Karbala resonates among angels and jinn. Allama Majlisi narrates a chapter titled "The Lament of the Jinn (Nawḥ al-Jinn)," detailing how jinn lament for Imam Husain (AS). Angels visit Karbala in such vast numbers that a group that comes once cannot return a second time. Every world is connected to Karbala, making its complete comprehension impossible for humans.

However, a person with even a glimpse of Gnosis will never object to mourning or question its practices. The speaker offers a recent observation from a psychiatrist: people fall into depression when one or two loved ones die. Yet, Imam Husain ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS) kept lifting bodies from the morning of Ashura until after noon.

### The Tragedy of Ali Akbar (AS)

Imam Husain's (AS) anguish reached a peak when he told his son, Ali Akbar (AS), "Go forward, O my son. Now you go. Go and be sacrificed." Ali Akbar (AS) eagerly awaited this moment.

#### Permission for Sacrifice

Imam Husain (AS) initially stopped Ali Akbar (AS) and instructed him to seek permission from his mother, Umm Layla, and his paternal aunt, Lady Zainab (AS).
Ali Akbar (AS) went to his mother, Umm Layla, and asked for permission to be sacrificed for his father. Umm Layla directed him to Lady Zainab (AS), who had raised him with immense love and care for 18 years.
When Ali Akbar (AS) stood before Lady Zainab (AS) and sought permission, she gazed at him from head to toe and said, "Son, was it for this day that I raised you with such love and care, that you would ask for permission to die?" Ali Akbar (AS) humbly responded, "Aunty, if you do not give me permission, it is alright. But if my grandmother asks on the Day of Judgment..." Lady Zainab (AS) then granted him permission.

Habib ibn Muzahir narrates that as Ali Akbar (AS) attempted to leave the tents, someone repeatedly grabbed his hem, pulling him back. It seemed as if a young man's funeral was leaving a full house. Though the identity of the person is not explicitly stated in the Maqtal (books of martyrdom), it is understood that it was likely his young sister, Sakina (AS), pleading, "Brother, have mercy on our poverty." Ali Akbar (AS) replied, "But my father is also poor."

Ali Akbar (AS) returned to Imam Husain (AS), who prepared him and seated him on his horse. Imam Husain (AS) looked towards the sky and prayed, "O Allah, be a witness against this nation. Such a young man has gone to fight them, who in character, in conduct, in appearance, in speech, in every way, was the most similar to Your Prophet. When we longed to see Your Prophet, we would look at Ali Akbar." Imam Husain (AS) then bid farewell.

Ali Akbar (AS) departed but had gone only a short distance when he heard a sound. He turned to see his old father, Imam Husain (AS), with his hand on his back, calling out, "O Ali, O Ali." Ali Akbar (AS) questioned, "O father, you had bid me farewell." Imam Husain (AS) replied, "O son, it is very hard to bid farewell to a young son."

#### Ali Akbar's Return and Thirst

Ali Akbar (AS) fought valiantly, sending at least 120 wretched individuals to Hell. Until then, no one who had gone to the battlefield had returned alive, except for Ali Akbar (AS). His return was prompted by a mother's heart. Umm Layla, unable to bear the suspense, asked Fizza to stand at the tent door and observe if the color of Imam Husain's (AS) face changed, indicating trouble for Ali Akbar (AS). When Fizza reported a change in the Imam's countenance, Umm Layla approached Imam Husain (AS) and inquired about the matter.

Imam Husain (AS) revealed that a renowned, well-fed and watered wrestler had come to fight Ali Akbar (AS), while his son had been hungry and thirsty for three days. Hearing this, Umm Layla, with a mother's heart, asked what she could do. Imam Husain (AS) advised her to pray, as a mother's prayer for her son is accepted. Umm Layla gathered the ladies to form a circle and prayed, "O Allah, for the sake of Husain's loneliness, O You who reunited Jacob with Joseph."

Before her prayer was even complete, Ali Akbar (AS) returned, but he was drenched in blood and covered in wounds. He made a desperate plea, "O father, will there be a sip of water? Thirst is killing me, and the weight of the sword is now very heavy on me." Imam Husain (AS), helpless as there was no water in the tents, offered his own tongue. Ali Akbar (AS) placed his tongue in his father's mouth but immediately pulled it back, exclaiming, "O father, your tongue has thorns in it." Imam Husain (AS) then gave him a ring, saying, "Son, keep this. Now you will continue to fight."

#### The Final Moments of Ali Akbar

Ali Akbar (AS) continued to fight. Suddenly, a lion-like warrior aimed at Ali Akbar's chest and threw a spear. The spear pierced Ali Akbar's chest, causing him to fall from his horse. Stumbling, he collapsed. The Maqtal tragically states that they began to cut Ali Akbar (AS) into pieces. Ali Akbar (AS) called out, "Father!"

Imam Husain (AS), holding his back, rushed to Ali Akbar's (AS) body. The Maqtal describes that as Husain (AS) approached, he attacked the wretched ones like a raging lion attacking its prey, pushing them away. When the wretched ones dispersed, Husain (AS) reached Ali Akbar (AS), placed his head on his lap, and pulled out the spear. A fountain of blood gushed out, and Ali Akbar (AS) breathed his last.

Imam Husain (AS) recited a eulogy: "O my son, after you, dust be upon the life of this world. O my son, you have been saved from the worries and sorrows of both worlds. Your father is all alone among the wretched."

The lecture concludes with a supplication to hasten the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (AS) and to be counted among his helpers. It asks for forgiveness of sins, removal of troubles, payment of debts, granting of righteous children, speedy recovery for the sick, safe return for those away from home, protection for Shias worldwide, and safeguarding of scholars, religious authorities, and holy shrines, especially that of Lady Zainab (AS). It ends by asking Allah to accept the humble mourning and grant the visitation and intercession of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad (peace be upon them).
