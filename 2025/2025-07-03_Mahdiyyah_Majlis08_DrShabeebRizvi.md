## Introductory Lament and Historical Narrative

### Lament for Abbas (AS)

Alas, Abbas! Alas, Abbas! Abbas, alas, Abbas! Alas, Abbas! The family of Imran said, and the living said, "Sister, you were captured, but you did not come, O Ghazi." When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling out, but you did not come, O Ghazi. The evening came, the standard was looted, the family of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) was plundered. On the burning sand, the world became lonely. To offer condolences, to meet you, father Ali (peace be upon him) came, but you did not come, O Ghazi. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling out, but you did not come.

If a tree were in trouble, it would be revived by you. My head is uncovered, don't you know? O standard-bearer of loyalty, by God, this sister had great hope in you, but you did not come, O Ghazi. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling out, but you did not come, O Ghazi. What can I say, my lion, these Muslims took us through city after city. Sometimes the people of Kufa, sometimes the people of Sham. We were repeatedly insulted, but you did not come, O Ghazi. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling out, but you did not come, O Ghazi.

How helpless is your sister, O king of loyalty! When the oppressor said, "The one you were so proud of, now call him," and I kept crying, but you did not come, O Ghazi. We did not get water, but may your fragrance remain. May your arms not be cut, even if the water-skin is pierced. But this could not be, your arms were severed. I am thirsty, but you did not come, O Ghazi. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling out, but you did not come, O Ghazi.

What should I say to Sakina, O peace of my heart? For water, all your blood was shed. Now there is no hope, you are not with me. Ropes are tied on my arms, but you did not come, O Ghazi. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling out, but you did not come, O Ghazi. When she walked, when she walked through the city, O my brave one, your sister with tied hands went a few steps. My brother called out, "Help me," but you did not come, O Ghazi. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling out, but you did not come, O Ghazi.

When Sakina met her fate in the prison, she was buried with a shroud of a dog's skin. In that difficulty, your name, like the fire of Ali (peace be upon him), she kept repeating, but you did not come, O Ghazi. You did not come, O Ghazi. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling out, but you did not come, O Ghazi. The pen of Raihan cried, writing the account. My Ghazi's standard was drenched in blood. Zainab's heart was wounded, O Ghazi. When my veil was snatched from my head, I kept calling out, but you did not come, O Ghazi.

### The Victory Letter of Karbala

The broken-hearted messenger of God writes the account of that night's defeat. Calling his scribes, Umar gave this order: "Write the victory letter quickly. What is the reality of our battle and fight? The son of the conqueror of Khaybar has been defeated. Let Medina, Yemen, Egypt, and Aleppo know. Let the victory letter be sent to every country. In every letter, let this be the content: Hussain has been killed, Zainab is without her veil. The throne and crown of the master of Imamat has been overthrown. If you ask who is the owner of the throne today, it is Yazid."

"Write on my behalf, write on my behalf, a petition to Yazid, that by your grace, Hussain has been martyred. I will present the head of the blessed Imam as a token of victory. A few women and ladies are in severe captivity. We did not even spare Ali Asghar. The honor of the Sayyadani's (descendants of the Prophet) is in your hands. But in the letter to Medina, write this in detail: Before the war, this was always the thought, that the Imam would fight for at least two months. And the brave men of Arabia are with the king of nations. The strength of God is with the son of the king of men. When they line up in the battlefield. But when the fight with the Hussainis began, it was the tenth of the month of Muharram, a Friday. Not two months passed, not even a day, that the army of Shabbir was killed in the afternoon. From dawn to noon, the army of the king was cut down. At the time of the afternoon prayer, the place where Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy family) used to kiss was cut. After the afternoon prayer, the head of Shabbir was severed. After looting the sanctuary, the evening call to prayer was said. In our army, all the Sayyadani's are captives. The grandson of the lion of God is bound in chains. The Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) does not come to help the family of the sanctuary. They call for Ali (peace be upon him), but Ali (peace be upon him) does not come."

#### The Messenger's Arrival in Medina

When the news of the messenger's arrival reached the city, the wretched messenger went to the mosque of Medina. The young and old left their homes and went to the mosque. He was saying the words of Hussain's messenger. The entire dome of the Prophet's (peace be upon him and his holy family) grave was shaking. The pillars of the mosque of the best of creation were shaking. He was still reading the letter on the pulpit, he had read only one sentence when there was an uproar. Suddenly, from the door of the mosque, a cry arose, "O dear ones, give way, the mother of Ahsan and Zahra is coming."

#### Umm al-Banin's Anguish and Interrogation

When the Hashimite women saw her, the messenger also showed respect and saluted. She stood with her forehead on the letter and said, "Brother, read this letter later. First, tell me, is the king well?" He started crying and said, "La ilaha illallah (There is no god but Allah). You are a great lover of Hussain and a martyr, but now in this world, you are in place of Zahra." She cried out, "How can I be like Batool? I am a servant, she is the mistress of the earth and time." He said, "Is your honor in this?" She said, "Yes, I am the widow of Ali (peace be upon him), the mother of the famous Abbas. But I am not a mother now, nor is he my son. Whatever is useful for Hussain, that is my heart. I do not talk to non-mahrams, this is not the way of Ali's (peace be upon him) maids. But the love of Hussain has made me helpless. I have come out wearing a veil in the marketplace. I long for the grave of Hussain, whose slave I am, whose mother I am. I am terrified, brother, you are with the poor, with torn clothes, with dust on your head."

#### The Messenger's Explanation: Abbas's Loyalty

He said, "Whatever grief I feel is little, O sorrowful one. The injustice done to Hussain by the cruel army. The hearts of stone and steel were slaughtered, and the story of that thirst was told. The sharp dagger and one Hussain. The buyer of the world's head and one Hussain. Thousands of oppressive arrows and one Hussain. A crowd of sorrows and pains and one Hussain. Not a drop of water was given to him by the enemies, the one whom Zahra had nursed. The mother of Abbas cried out, the mother of Abbas cried out, "Is there any news of his life?" He said, "I am telling you, calm your heart, lady, calm down. That thirst of three days and that state of thirst. That helplessness, that poverty, that scene of the battlefield. Shabbir would look at the river with longing. Shabbir would lick his dry lips. Which sorrow should I tell you, O sorrowful one? There was no one to hold the stirrup of the master of the pure. Hussain's sister came out of the tent with a torn garment. She was putting dust on her hair with both hands. The enemy's army cried at that time, when Zainab held her brother's stirrup."

Hearing this, Umm al-Banin was shocked. She cried out in anger, "What happened to Abbas? Did you think holding the stirrup was a disgrace today? Here, he used to lift the sandals of the master of martyrs. There was no habit of pride in my son. Holding the stirrup was an honor, a blessing." She cried out towards Najaf, "O Ali (peace be upon him), help! See how well your Abbas has done. Is this what you call loyalty? The rights of the one who raised him have been destroyed. Do you hear what this messenger is saying? A slave remains in the service of his master like this." The messenger cried out, "Listen to me, please. God is my witness that loyalty ends with Abbas. I mentioned the ride of the afternoon. When the master was about to ride in the morning, the standard was in his hand, he was ready to ride. Your son was present to hold the stirrup. Akbar, the blessed one, was holding the reins. Qasim was waving a handkerchief over his uncle's head. The army of Hussain was behind him with glory. In the morning, this was the splendor, and at the time of decline, there was no army, no soldiers, no crowd of people. Neither Qasim, nor Ali Akbar, nor Abbas. Saying goodbye to the ladies of the Prophet's (peace be upon him and his holy family) family, the master stood at the door of the tent, helpless and alone. There was no one to hold the stirrup, what a tragedy. Hussain was looking at the battlefield and the river. He was calling for Ali Akbar and crying. He was calling for his brother and crying. He was calling for Ali Akbar and crying. He was calling for his brother and crying."

## Formal Introduction and Central Hadith

(اللھم صلی علی محمد و آل محمد)
...the infallible ones from whom Allah has removed all impurity and purified them with a thorough purification.

(اللھم صلی علی امام زماننا و ولی امرنا و حبیب قلوبنا و طبیب نفوسنا و مولانا و حبیبنا و طبیبنا علیه آلاف التحیة و الثناء)
...the straight path, may our souls be sacrificed for him.

(و مولانا سیدنا الحسین ابن علی علیہما السلام)
...the right of worship. Allah is sufficient. Our master Hussain ibn Ali, peace be upon him, spoke the truth.

(حق عبادته آتاه اللہ فوق أمنيته و كفايته صدق مولانا الحسین ابن علی علیہ السلام)
Blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.
(صلواۃ اللھم صلی علی محمد و آل محمد)

### The Hadith on Worship and Gnosis

The noble hadith that has been chosen for this series of ten majalis, in this hadith, the Master of Martyrs (Sayyid al-Shuhada) says: "Whoever worships Allah as He deserves to be worshipped, Allah will grant him more than his wishes and his needs." The discussion was about worship and gnosis (Ma'rifat), and the point reached was that both reason ('Aql) and revelation (Naql) demand, that is, it is the verdict of reason and also the verdict of the Quran and hadith, that there must be a guide (Hadi), a leader, who guides people, who guides humanity. That guide, that leader, should be one who has knowledge from Allah, and he himself should be a light, so that whoever holds fast to him, whoever holds him firmly, becomes guided and himself guided.

## The Imam as the Proof of God (Hujjatullah)

Continuing this series, what is the position of the Imam? What is the reality of the Imamate? I will present a few more points to you. And that is that the Imam is the proof of God (Hujjatullah). He is the proof from Allah, and the earth can never be empty of a proof.

### Defining "Hujjat"

When we use the word "hujjat," in the dictionary, its meaning is that when a person presents a proof, if that proof is complete, it is called a hujjat, meaning an argument. So when a person presents that argument, the other person has no answer left. This is the meaning of hujjat. That is, a hujjat is such an argument, such a statement, such a thing to present, such a proof to present, that the other person becomes silent. If he is stubborn, obstinate, that is another matter. Otherwise, if he is a person of reason, he will accept that proof and become silent.

### Quranic Basis for Divine Proof

This word has been used several times in the Holy Quran. But the famous verse in this regard, I will present one or two to you. The most famous is this:

إِنَّا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ شَاهِدًا وَمُبَشِّرًا وَنَذِيرًا
"Indeed, We have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner"
- [Reference needed]

We sent messengers as bearers of good news, that is, giving good news, and as warners. Good news of what? Of happiness in this world, that is, good fortune, and paradise in the hereafter. And warners of what? Of Allah's punishment in this world and Allah's punishment in the hereafter, that is, hell. The Prophet's (peace be upon him and his holy family) job is both, he gives good news and he warns. Allah says in the verse of Surah An-Nisa (verse 165):

رُّسُلًا مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَزِيزًا حَكِيمًا
"Messengers as bearers of good news and as warners, so that mankind should not have any argument against Allah after the messengers. And Allah is ever All-Mighty, All-Wise."
- [Reference needed]

Allah says, "We sent messengers," that is, the thing that is hidden in it is that "We sent messengers as bearers of good news and as warners." Why did He send them? Allah says, "So that after the coming of the messengers, people will have no argument, no proof, no argument left." Now they cannot say that we did not know, because Allah gave man reason and also sent messengers, and He also gave him gnosis in his nature. So all three aspects, Allah covered all three. He made his creation in such a way that it was based on gnosis. He gave him the light of reason, through which he could distinguish between right and wrong. And He also sent messengers so that after that, that is, when the messenger gives a reminder, after the messenger's reminder, after the messenger's reminder, people will have no other argument left. That is, Allah completed the proof to such an extent.

And Allah also mentioned the argument that people would still make if Allah did not do these three things. And Allah also stated that in the Quran. And what is it? They would say:

لَوْلَا أَرْسَلْتَ إِلَيْنَا رَسُولًا فَنَتَّبِعَ آيَاتِكَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن نَّذِلَّ وَنَخْزَىٰ
"If only You had sent to us a messenger, we would have followed Your verses before we were humiliated and disgraced."
- [Reference needed]

They would say, "If You had sent to us a messenger who would warn us and tell us not to do this, we would have followed Your signs and Your instructions. We would have followed Your words, Your instructions, if You had sent him, before we were humiliated and disgraced in this world and humiliated and disgraced in the hereafter." A verse has come in the Quran that it is very clear that Allah has sent it very clearly. Now people have no proof left to say that if we had known. That is why when Allah throws people into hell, the angels will ask the people of hell:

أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌ
"Did not a warner come to you?"
- [Reference needed]

Nazir means a warner. "Did not a warner come to you?" They said, Allah is also telling their answer, what they will answer. They will say:

قَالُوا بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَاءَنَا نَذِيرٌ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ اللَّهُ مِن شَيْءٍ
"Yes, a warner certainly came, but we rejected him and said, 'Allah has not revealed anything.'"
- [Reference needed]

That is, messengers came, Imams came, successors came, everyone came. "But we rejected them. We did not believe them. And we said that Allah has not revealed anything. Allah has not revealed any Quran. Allah has not sent any messengers. Allah has not sent any light," the light that we mentioned yesterday. They deny it. "We did not know. We were not aware that Allah had sent anything." That is why when they say this, Allah says, "They are insulting Me." Whose insult is this answer? It is an insult to Allah. Allah says, "They are insulting Me." How? Allah says in the Quran:

وَمَا قَدَرُوا اللَّهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ
"And they have not valued Allah as He should be valued."
- [Reference needed]

That is, when someone is not valued as he should be, it is an insult to him. It is his humiliation. He is being insulted. His honor is being violated. So this is a verse of the Quran, "They have not valued Allah as He should be valued." Why? Because when they say that Allah has not sent anyone, Allah has not sent anyone, so there are many verses in the Quran about the proof, that Allah completes the proof in this way, by sending messengers, prophets, successors, Imams, everyone. Now no argument is left at any time. And I have presented to you that Allah has also given reason and has also given gnosis in human nature. Now nothing is left. Nothing is left at all.

### The Purpose of Prophets and Messengers

That is why the existence of an Imam and a proof, a messenger and a proof, is necessary in the world. And this proof has many benefits, many benefits, which are seen in the traditions. Remember one thing, that people need a proof. It is not obligatory on Allah to send a proof. People are in need of a proof. That is, people say that it is obligatory on Allah to send a prophet. No, it is not obligatory on Allah. This is Allah's grace, Allah's favor. It has come in the Quran:

لَقَدْ مَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذْ بَعَثَ فِيهِمْ رَسُولًا مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ يَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِهِ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَإِن كَانُوا مِن قَبْلُ لَفِي ضَلَالٍ مُّبِينٍ
"Indeed, Allah conferred a favor upon the believers when He sent among them a messenger from themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom, although they had been before in clear error."
- [Reference needed]

Allah did a favor. A favor is not obligatory. Allah did a favor to the believers when He sent a messenger among them. And then what does that messenger do? The duties of the messenger are described. A messenger from among them. What does this messenger do? He recites the verses, and he purifies their souls, and he teaches them the book and wisdom. This is the job of the prophet, and this is the job of the proof. So Allah does a favor. But in this verse, what? Allah does a favor to the believers. This favor is for the believers. A favor means a good deed. That is, through this favor, the believers will go to paradise. So for those who are not believers, what is the coming of the prophet? If the coming of the prophet is a favor for the believer, and the existence of the proof is a favor, then what is it for the non-believer? So for the non-believer, it is a calamity. That is, the original word is "wabal." Coming to Bombay, it became "bawal." What is the original word? "Wabal." "Wabal" means destruction. So for the other, it is destruction. Why? Because the proof was completed. After the coming of the prophet, the proof was completed. Now when the proof is completed, when they come on the Day of Judgment, they will have no argument left against Allah. That is why Allah does a favor.

### Is Sending a Proof Obligatory on Allah?

So it is not obligatory on Allah. Understand. If Allah did not send any prophet, understand, if Allah does not send any prophet, Allah does not send any messenger, no message comes, no book comes, no problem. There is no problem. Humans also roam like animals, everyone roams like that. Then it would be that Allah could not ask questions. Then Allah could not do the accounting on the Day of Judgment. The accounting only happens when after the proof has come and after the statement has been made, when all the proofs have been stated, all the rules have been stated, the religion has been stated, the law has been stated, the beliefs have been stated, the rules have been stated, the ethics have been stated, the etiquette has been stated, when all things have been stated, now after that there will be an accounting. Just like in a school where all things are taught and after teaching, an exam is taken. If, understand, nothing was taught in school, as you saw a few days ago in COVID, there are many schools where nothing was taught, so everyone was passed just like that. Is it clear? So if Allah does not send, there would be no question and answer. So these are very important discussions from the point of view of belief. For children, I am talking about it one by one, slowly, in the service of Islam.

## Islam as Complete Submission (Taslim)

Now, after this, why is the proof of God necessary? Look, now Allah sent people, sent the Sharia, sent books, Allah sent everything. Allah completed the entire religion. Through whom did He complete the religion? Through the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family.
(صلی اللہ علیہ و آلہ و سلم)
(اللھم صلی علی محمد و آل محمد)

### The Universal Nature of Islam

Okay, let me also present this point to you, that the religion from Adam to the Messenger of Allah was one religion, not different religions. The nations were different, otherwise the religion was one religion. And it is mentioned in the Quran:

إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِندَ اللَّهِ الْإِسْلَامُ
"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam."
- [Reference needed]

Here, Islam is not the name of the religion. Look, what do we think? That the religion is Islam. Islam is not here, Islam does not mean that name, it is not a proper noun. Rather, the religion in the sight of Allah, here the meaning of religion is complete submission (Taslim). It is submission to Allah. The name of submission to Allah is Islam. Whatever is the command of Allah, to submit to it completely, that is Islam.

### The Example of Iblis's Defiance

That is why when Iblis argued, "Don't give me this order to prostrate in respect, I will do anything else." Allah said, "No, I don't need your worship at all. If you want to worship, then do it as I say, not as you say. My will is that My worship should be as I want, not as you want. Nothing happens by your wanting. Worship will be as I say." This is called Islam. This is called submission. This is called submission.

## Distortion and Preservation of Religion After the Prophet (PBUH&HF)

But now what happened? After the Messenger of Allah, the same thing happened again. The Messenger of Allah completed Islam. In Ghadir, the verse came. The verse came. The Quran was compiled after the Messenger of Allah. The verse was inserted between the verses of meat. That all the verses of meat came, that you can eat this meat, you cannot eat that meat, you can eat this, you cannot eat that, you cannot eat that, you cannot eat that. And after that, this happened with Islam. This happened with the verses of Islam.

### Compilation of the Quran and its Alterations

Because the Quran was compiled after the Messenger of Allah. It was compiled during the time of the third ruler. Not during the time of the first ruler, not during the time of the second ruler, but during the time of the third ruler, when the Quran was compiled. And the name of the compiler was Zayd ibn Thabit.

#### Ali's (AS) Compiled Quran

And the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), who was with the Messenger of Allah from the beginning to the end, when he brought his Quran, compiled, he was told, "We do not need your Quran." So the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) Ali ibn Abi Talib, peace and blessings be upon him,
(علیہ الصلوۃ والسلام)
(اللھم صلی علی محمد و آل محمد)
took the Quran and came back. When he came back, those people got scared. They got scared and thought that Ali might make this Quran public, distribute it among the people. Then people will find out that this is the real Quran, this is the verse in it, this is the interpretation, this is the exegesis. Then there will be a big problem. So the man himself came and said with great respect and reverence, "O Abu al-Hasan, there was a small mistake. Can you tell us about the Quran you compiled? Will you give it?" The Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) understood all the conspiracies of each one. And the Commander of the Faithful's (Amir al-Mu'minin) sentence is also there. What is the Commander of the Faithful's (Amir al-Mu'minin) sentence? You know, it is famous. The Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) says, "If there was no fear of God, Ali would have told you what politics is. The son of Abu Talib would have told you what politics is, if there was no fear of God." Ali was well aware of the fear of God. He understood everything, every single thing. Now he came and was talking very respectfully. In the morning, he had spoken in a very strange way, that "We do not need your Quran." Because when Ali showed the Quran, he saw, "Oh, these are all virtues in red lines. This is written in blue lines. Oh, what is this? This is all virtues everywhere, the virtues of the Ahl al-Bayt. Oh, our mention is also in it." So he said, "No, Ali, we do not need this Quran."

#### The Demand to "Change the Quran"

Okay, its mention is also in the Quran. Remember, I am telling the children, it is in Surah Yunus (verse 15), go and read it:

وَإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُنَا بَيِّنَاتٍ ۙ قَالَ الَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَاءَنَا ائْتِ بِقُرْآنٍ غَيْرِ هَٰذَا أَوْ بَدِّلْهُ
"And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who do not expect the meeting with Us say, 'Bring us a Quran other than this or change it.'"
- [Reference needed]

"And those who do not expect to meet Allah on the Day of Judgment, they think they will never die, they will always live in this world." The Quran is saying, pay attention to the words of the Quran. "Those people think they will never die, they will always live in this world. O Prophet, either bring another Quran or change this one. Either bring another Quran or change it." This was their demand. Now a voice came from there, the voice of truth came:

قُلْ مَا يَكُونُ لِي أَنْ أُبَدِّلَهُ مِن تِلْقَاءِ نَفْسِي ۖ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ
"Say, 'It is not for me to change it on my own accord. I only follow what is revealed to me.'"
- [Reference needed]

"O Prophet, tell them, it is not possible for me to change it on my own. It is not possible for me to change the Quran on my own. I only follow what has been revealed to me, what revelation has come, what Allah has said, I just follow that. I am not doing anything other than that." In the commentary of this verse, the Imam says, "Or change it," that is, they were saying, peace be upon him, read salawat.
(علیہ السلام)
Why is this Ali coming again and again? Remove this Ali. Or, this is a verse of the Quran, "Or change it." See, two verses, you are understanding the delicacy of the matter, aren't you? They were demanding two things. One demand was, "Either change the Quran or change it." Meaning, if you cannot change the Quran, no problem. Change this thing inside the Quran. Remove it. What was that thing that they were asking to be removed? What was that thing that was bothering them? So this was a very difficult issue, brother, very difficult.

#### Insertion of Ayat al-Tathir (Verse of Purification)

So anyway, now this happened after the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family). Now the Quran was compiled. Now it was compiled, the verses were inserted. Look, this is one or two examples, this is not one example. We can bring you many such examples from the Quran. For example, the verse of purification (Ayat al-Tathir) was inserted between the verses of the wives. The verses of the wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) are being discussed. Whose discussion is it? The wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) are being discussed. And is it a good discussion? No, you read all the verses. Read Surah Al-Ahzab. Read verse number 33 of Surah Al-Ahzab. Read the verses before it. Read the verses after it. So the verse of purification is inserted in the middle. Allah, read Surah Al-Ahzab, verse number 33:

وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ ۖ وَأَقِمْنَ الصَّلَاةَ وَآتِينَ الزَّكَاةَ وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ ۚ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمُ الرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيرًا
"And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [was] the display of the former times of ignorance. And establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah only intends to remove from you all impurity, O people of the [Prophet's] household, and to purify you with a thorough purification."
- [Reference needed]

The address is, "O wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family)! O wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family)! Stay in your houses and do not go out of your houses." Who do you say this to? Who do you say this to, about whom there is a fear that as soon as they get a chance, they will go out? Or else, have a lock put on from the outside. Is it clear? "And do not display yourselves as you used to display yourselves in the time of ignorance." And as you used to go out without hijab in the time of ignorance, do not go out like that now. It is strange. This is a verse of the Quran, brother. It is a verse of Surah Al-Ahzab. Read it. Now I don't know if this is a verse of praise. I don't know what it is. If you people decide for yourselves, brother, is this a verse of praise? "Tabarruj," that is, you say to a child, "Look, stay at home and don't make mischief and don't break anything." So they say, that child was so innocent, so innocent, that this verse came in his praise. It is being said in his praise that, "Son, who does not break things, does not make mischief, it is a great praise." This is a verse of the Quran, brother. We are not saying it. If anyone has an objection, they should object to Allah. Allah is saying, "Look, offer prayers, offer prayers, give zakat, and look, obey Allah and His Messenger. Did you understand or not?" Allahu Akbar! You are not understanding the matter at all. You are not understanding the Quran, brother. We are reading the Quran and you are feeling bad. Brother, if it is the Quran, then why are you feeling bad? Brother, you yourself tell me, what is the tone? Is it of praise or not of praise? Okay?

#### Misinterpretation of Ayat al-Tathir

Now what did they do? They were very clever. In the middle came the verse of purification. "And Allah only desires," that is, Allah's intention is, "O Ahl al-Bayt (People of the Household), Allah's intention is to keep all filth, all evil, all impurity, all sins, all filth away from you." Wow, wow, Subhanallah! Nothing can come near. Nothing can come near the Ahl al-Bayt. Neither filth can come, nor impurity can come, nor filth can come, nor sin can come. Allah has willed to purify, which is the right of purification. Now if Allah keeps something pure, then what? Does anyone have the power that any filth, any impurity can come near it? You decide for yourself. So this was the situation. This is the history from the beginning of Islam. You understand. Don't think that this is a matter of today. This has been going on like this from the beginning. Now after this, what did they do? They inserted the verse of purification in the middle of the verses of the wives and said, "This also came for the wives. This is also in it. The wives are also part of the Ahl al-Bayt." Whereas the tradition is from the hadith that Zayd ibn Arqam was asked if the wives are from the Ahl al-Bayt. He said, "No." He was asked why. He said, "Because once a man divorces his wife, she goes back to her father's house. Now no relationship remains. The Ahl al-Bayt are those with whom there is a blood relationship. There is a blood relationship. The Ahl al-Bayt are those on whom sadaqa is forbidden." This is the tradition of Zayd ibn Arqam, which is present in the Sihah Sittah.

### The Imam's Role in Preserving the Religion

Anyway, now this happened. This happened with the religion. Now what to do? Now here the proof of God comes in handy. Now look, the tradition is present in Kafi. Now look, what is the hadith? Imam Sadiq (peace be upon him) says, look, let me tell you one thing, that all these arguments are all logical, all rational arguments. That is, there is no bias in it. And our school of thought, the religion, which we follow, the Ahl al-Bayt (peace be upon them), and we have taken this from the verse of the Quran. The Quran says:

قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ
"Say, 'Bring your proof if you are truthful.'"
- [Reference needed]

Bring your proofs. Allah says in the Quran, Allah has given an open challenge. We are giving the same challenge, that if you are truthful, then bring your proof. We will accept your proof before you. If your proof is true, then bring the proof. Bringing fabricated hadiths, all that will not work. Because there was a ban on hadith for 100 years. There was a ban for 100 years on hadiths. From 11 AH to 110 AH, there was a complete ban. There was a total ban on hadiths. After that, hadith factories were set up. In fact, the factory was set up immediately before that. Hadiths were fabricated. And we are not saying this, all Muslims have written this in their books. We are not saying it. Do you know this? That the entire hadith was being fabricated, was being fabricated. In fact, this work had started in the life of the Messenger of Allah himself, in the life of the Messenger of Allah, that hadiths began to be made in the life of the Messenger of Allah. And that is why the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) himself said, "The liars who attribute lies to me are many." There are many people who are attributing lies, fabricating hadiths. This is what happened.

#### Correcting Additions and Deficiencies

Anyway, now what does the Imam say? Look, the Imam says, "The earth cannot be empty without an Imam." The earth without an Imam, which Imam? The one whom Allah appoints. Yes, that Imam, his mention will also come later. The Imam whom Allah appoints, the Imam who is the successor of the Messenger of Allah. Why? The Imam presents the proof. The Imam, so that if the believers add something to the religion, if due to their mistake, due to ignorance, it happens, because if any person is not infallible, then it is possible that if he is not following the Imams completely, is not following the Quran well, is not holding fast, then it is possible that he may add something of his own to the religion. As many people do, even today they do. What is the job of the Imam? That if they add something, add something, the Imam then subtracts it again. He says, "No, this thing is not in the religion." And if the believers fall behind, if there is any deficiency, any shortcoming, the Imam completes it.

#### The Imam as the Continual Proof of God

So it is very necessary to present this point now, that remember, the proof of God, Allah placed it before the creation, and it is with the creation, and it is after the creation. "The proof is before the creation, with the creation, and after the creation." Allah's proof, that is, the divine proof, is before the creation, with the creation, and after the creation. It is always with it. That is, Allah has kept it from the beginning to the end. Yesterday, I presented to you that the meaning of "Wajhullah" (Face of God) is this. And then in another hadith, two Imams, Imam Baqir and Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them),
(اللھم صلی علی محمد و آل محمد)
say, "Indeed, Allah does not leave the earth without a scholar." Here, by scholar, it means the Imam. That is, the scholar who has knowledge of the unseen. The scholar who has the knowledge of the Messenger of Allah, he is called a scholar. In fact, without a scholar, that is, by scholar, it means the Imam. If this Imam is not there, then the truth cannot be distinguished from falsehood. No one will be able to distinguish between right and wrong. No one will be able to distinguish what is right and what is wrong.

## The Unparalleled Virtues of Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS)

That is why the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) addressed the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him),
(اللھم صلی علی محمد و آل محمد)
The Messenger of Allah addressed him and said, "O Ali, if you were not there, after me, the believers would have no identity. Because of you, the believers have an identity." Who is a believer? The one who follows Ali ibn Abi Talib. The one who follows Ali is a believer. The one who leaves Ali is out of faith. He is gone. And after the Messenger of Allah, Ali was the path of guidance. He used to tell from misguidance that this is guidance, this is misguidance. This is guidance, this is deviation. This is the right path, this is the wrong path. Only Ali could tell this. And the children of Ali. The Messenger of Allah was from guidance, from guidance to misguidance. And Ali was the light. "Ama," "ama" means blindness. Blindness. The one who does not have Ali is spiritually blind. Spiritually blind. This is also taken from the Quran. Yes, brother, don't think that the sentences of the hadith are from our own side. No, Allah says in the Quran, "We have created the majority of jinn and men for hell. We have given them intellect, but they do not use this intellect. They have eyes, but they cannot see. They do not see, they do not use their eyes." Which eyes are these? These are not these eyes. Everyone has these eyes.

### Ali (AS) as the Identity of Believers

So here are the sentences of Dua Nudba. Allah and Ali are the strong rope of Allah. The strong rope of Allah, which is called the strong rope in English. Who is the strong rope of Allah? It is Ali ibn Abi Talib. The straight path of Allah is Ali Talib.

### Ali (AS) as the "Strong Rope of Allah" and "Straight Path"

In kinship, no one was closer to the Messenger of Allah than Ali. No one was closer in kinship. No one could say that we are. No one can say that we are closer to the Messenger of Allah in kinship than Ali. And in religion too, no one was ahead of Ali. Oh, brother, what is religion? Religion is the name of beliefs. Religion is the name of knowledge. Religion is the name of courage. Religion is the name of perfections. Religion is the name of perfection, isn't it?

### Ali's (AS) Unrivaled Excellence

Now you bring it in anything, brother, bring it. If anyone is ahead of Ali in knowledge, then tell me. If anyone is ahead of Ali in courage and bravery, then tell me. Bring it. Bring the proof. From the books. Not from our book, bring it from your book. The late Allama Qaisingi Puri, may Allah be pleased with him, says, "Everyone fled in Uhud, except for one with a heavy heart, the pride of God. No one was around the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family), neither the father-in-law, nor the brother-in-law, nor Haidari, ya Ali, Haidari, ya, ya Ali." No one was there. You read the history. Who was in Badr? Who was in Uhud? Who was in Khandaq? Who was in Khaybar? Wherever you look, when he was challenging, "Is there any combatant?" and he was challenging the Messenger of Allah, "Is there any man among you? You children of 12 men." You read the history, brother. We will not say. The Muslims were sitting in such a way that as if there was no one more pious and God-fearing than them. Voices were coming out of their mouths out of fear of God. There was so much piety among the Muslims that everyone was sitting silently. And he was being challenged. He was asking, "Who will fight?" So much so that the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) had to say, "Who will put this dog in its place?" Even then, no one came forward. And after that, there was only one, the attacker who does not flee, Ali ibn Abi Talib (peace be upon him).
(اللھم صلی علی محمد و آل محمد)

#### No Comparison in Knowledge, Courage, or Generosity

Brother, read the books. And let me tell you one more thing before moving on, very important. And that is, tell your children about these wars. Because nowadays, very few people read from the pulpits. They say, "Read about prayer, read about fasting." Brother, you should tell about all these wars. As a very great scholar said, "Brother, ever since people stopped reading about the wars of Ali ibn Abi Talib from the pulpit, mothers have stopped giving birth to brave children. People like that have started to be born among us too." These wars should be read. They should also be read from the pulpit. People should read them. And if not, then at least read what is written in the books and narrate it. Tell the children so that they know who were the ones who came forward to defend the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family). Anyway, so it is a sentence of the supplication, "In religion, no one is ahead in knowledge, no one is ahead in courage, no one is ahead in generosity, in anything." That is, there is no comparison to Ali ibn Abi Talib. Look, now pay attention to the sentence, brother. We are not saying that it was 19-20. No, no, there was no comparison at all. That is, in Arabic, there is a saying, a proverb is used, they say, "Qiyas al-fariq." That is, when two things cannot be compared, in Arabic it is called "qiyas al-fariq." That is, two things cannot be compared. They say, "Where are the darknesses of the earth and where are the heights of the sky?" Is there any comparison? Now many children, or maybe some people may not understand this example that we are giving, it is an Arabic example. So now, in the Hindi example, they say, "Where is Raja Bhoj and where is Gangu Teli?" There is no comparison. When there is no comparison, it means that there was no comparison of anyone.

#### The Fabrication of Hadiths Against Ali (AS)

Now later, hadiths were fabricated. And such hadiths were fabricated, if we tell you, you will say, look, the treasury is not correct in Muharram. You will say, such hadiths, such hadiths were fabricated, such hadiths were fabricated that are not even worth mentioning now. And they themselves knew that the hadiths were fabricated. They also knew it. In fact, a very great scholar of the Ahl al-Sunnah, Ibn Abi al-Hadid al-Mu'tazili, his book is "Sharh Nahj al-Balagha." He wrote a complete explanation of Nahj al-Balagha in 20 volumes. He was not a Shia. Ibn Abi al-Hadid al-Mu'tazili was a very great scholar of Baghdad. He brought a whole chapter on this topic. The name of the chapter itself is "The Hadiths That Were Fabricated in Condemnation of Ali." You think.

### Ali's (AS) Unique Proximity to the Prophet (PBUH&HF)

Anyway, so this is the Commander of the Faithful's (Amir al-Mu'minin) virtues. The virtues of Ali, that is, virtues, excellence, merits, virtues, no one could reach Ali. "He followed in the footsteps of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon them both." That is, Ali just followed in the footsteps where the Messenger of Allah walked. In fact, in one place, Allah called Ali, called the Messenger of Allah separately and called Ali separately. And He placed Ali on this side and the Messenger of Allah on that side. And to create a sense of personal need in the angels, a sense of personal need, that is, to experience one's own sense of inferiority, Gabriel, who was such a great angel, who came with the Messenger of Allah on the Mi'raj, at one stage he says, "O Messenger of Allah, now you go ahead." So the Messenger of Allah said, "Gabriel, why are you not coming with me?" The Messenger of Allah knew, but he wanted to make Gabriel say it. So Gabriel said, "If I go forward even a little bit, that is, even this much, that is, the size of a fingernail, even this much, that is, the size of a fingernail," so the Arabic sentence is, "If I go forward even this much, the size of a fingernail, I will burn. I will not be able to bear it. There is so much light here, I will not be able to bear it." So the Messenger of Allah went forward. To what extent did he go forward? The Quran says, this is a verse of the Quran, a verse of Surah An-Najm (verses 8-9). We are reading the verses of Surah An-Najm. Yes, brother, this is not a hadith:

ثُمَّ دَنَا فَتَدَلَّىٰ فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ أَوْ أَدْنَىٰ
"Then he approached and descended, and was at a distance of two bow-lengths or nearer."
- [Reference needed]

The Messenger of Allah came so close, the Messenger of Allah came so close, that now the proximity was such that, like in a bow, there is an arrow, so like the two points of the bow, in a semi-circle, the two points, the Messenger of Allah was that close. Now the Quran said this, "He drew near," that is, he became close, "or even closer." That is, or even closer. Rather, here "aw," when "aw" comes in the Quran for Allah, it is not for doubt, but rather, even closer, he was closer than that. He was closer than that. Who was the Messenger of Allah close to? If we say that Allah was sitting, then we have limited Allah by place. Allah became a resident of a place. The one who lives in a place is limited. The one who is limited, who is limited, is not Allah. So now who was this? Now it is found in the traditions that when the Messenger of Allah started the conversation, the voice that came from the other side of the curtain was the voice of Ali ibn Abi Talib.
(نعرہ حیدری یا حیدری یا علی)
This is Ali ibn Abi Talib. There is no comparison, brother. You are fabricating hadiths for no reason. By praising someone, no one becomes great in this way that you think that we will elevate them, they will be elevated. No one is elevated. The world knows. Now it is a different matter that there has been some negligence on our part too. We did not propagate as we should have. We did not convey the message as we should have. And that is why there were always very few people with the Imams, who could be counted on fingers.

## Exemplar of Loyalty: Yahya ibn Umm al-Tawil

God willing, tomorrow I will mention to you such a companion of the Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) and a companion of Ali. Because there is no time now. I will just mention a small companion and then come to the مصائب (tragedies). Because the children are not familiar with this name, so I am telling you to read all these names. And then after that, nowadays, praise be to Allah, it is the age of Google. Now Google has become the age of Chat GPT. You search, you will find it.

### Yahya's Courageous Stance

Yahya ibn Umm al-Tawil. His name was Yahya. I am saying Umm al-Tawil. He is a very special companion of Imam Zain al-Abidin (peace be upon him). Very special. Look at his courage. Look at the way of conveying the message. He is standing in the Prophet's (peace be upon him and his holy family) Mosque. He is telling the worshipers in the Prophet's (peace be upon him and his holy family) Mosque, "We do not consider you Muslims until you believe in Ali." From the verse of the Quran, the verse of Surah Mumtahanah (verse 4):

كَفَرْنَا بِكُمْ وَبَدَا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةُ وَالْبَغْضَاءُ أَبَدًا حَتَّىٰ تُؤْمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ
"We have disbelieved in you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone."
- [Reference needed]

"We have disbelieved in you." "We do not consider you Muslims until you believe in Allah." Yahya used to use this verse and stand in the Prophet's (peace be upon him and his holy family) Mosque and say, "Look, we don't even know who Umm al-Tawil is." Now when he started doing this regularly, not just once, what happened? People complained to the ruler. They went and said, "This is a very mischievous person. He is corrupting our faith. He keeps telling people things like this." So he called him and said, "Do you say things like this?" He said, "Yes, I say things like this." He did not say, "No, sorry, sorry." He said, "Yes, I say things like this. I also believe it." Wow! He not only says it, he also believes it. He knows the consequences. "And do whatever you want to do."

### Imam Zain al-Abidin's (AS) Reaction to his Martyrdom

And it is a very detailed story. I am not narrating it now, I am speaking in a very short way. He just killed Yahya ibn Umm al-Tawil. He was martyred. When the news of his martyrdom reached Imam Zain al-Abidin (peace be upon him), the Imam said, "May Allah's mercy be upon him." The master did not say, "Oh, he did wrong. He should not have done this. Oh, he should have used taqiyya. Oh, he should have done this. Oh, no, no." He said, "May Allah's mercy be upon him." The survival of the religion. For the survival of the religion, a person should do everything. And what is the religion? It is the message of the Ahl al-Bayt. There is nothing other than that.

## The Tragic Martyrdom of Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas (AS)

And this was the thing, this was the thing in which the son of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas, was completely immersed. He was so completely immersed that he never considered himself equal to Hussain. He was the commander of the army. Abu al-Fadl al-Abbas was the standard-bearer. He was the standard-bearer. But Hussain did not give him permission to fight. Until the day of Ashura came.

### Sakina's Hope and Abbas's Resolve

Once, a voice came at the door of the tent, "Sakina, daughter Sakina." Sakina came running. Hearing her uncle's voice, the niece came running. "Uncle, how did you remember me?" There was great love between Sakina and Abbas. Great, great love. And great hopes. Many hopes. So Sakina, "O uncle, how did you remember me?" He said, "Daughter, bring the water-skin." She said, "Uncle, what will we do with the water-skin?" He said, "I went to the master and I asked for permission to fight. The master said, 'No, you bring water for the children.' So bring it, I will bring water for you. Bring it, I will bring water for the children." As soon as Sakina heard this, she went running and brought the water-skin. Now the little children who saw the water-skin in Sakina's hand said, "Bibi, where are you taking this water-skin?" She said, "My uncle is now going to bring water. Father has ordered him. Father has ordered my uncle to bring water. Children, now be satisfied. Now water will surely come. My uncle will bring water." Sakina gave the water-skin to Abbas. Abbas took this water-skin and left.

### The Journey to the Euphrates

Now when Abbas left, there was such awe and majesty that he pushed aside the armies. Abbas's mere glance was enough. Abbas's mere awe and majesty was enough. The soldiers started running here and there. Abbas took the horse into the Euphrates. The horse entered. Abbas dismounted from the horse. He filled the water-skin. He took water in his hands and said, "O wretches, do not think that I am helpless, I am helpless. I can drink water, but I will not drink it because the children in the tent are thirsty. My niece is thirsty." Abbas filled the water-skin.

### The Severing of Hands and the Pierced Water-Skin

After filling the water-skin, Abbas mounted the horse again. Abbas mounted and as soon as he started towards the tent, Harmala shot such an arrow of oppression that the arrow hit the water-skin. Before that, what did the wretches do? They cut off Abbas's right hand. Abbas recited a rajaz, "If you cut off my right hand, I will still continue to serve my master." Then they cut off his left hand. Abbas held the water-skin with his teeth. Now when he held it with his teeth, he was still going towards the tent. Both hands were now gone. Once, an arrow of oppression was shot. Harmala shot such an arrow that it hit the water-skin. The water started to flow. As soon as the water flowed, Abbas thought, "Now what will I do by going to the tent?" He stood with his head bowed.

### Abbas's Fall and Hussain's Agony

As soon as he stood with his head bowed, a wretch, a cursed one, hit him on the head with such a mace that the lion of Ali, the lion of Ali, fell from the back of the horse onto the land of Karbala. He fell on the land of Karbala. O mourners, O mourners, remember, whenever someone falls from a height, falls down, what does he do naturally, in a natural way? He first puts his hands forward. Alas, my oppressed one, Abbas fell on his face. The wretches attacked. Abbas called out, "Master, accept my last farewell. My last farewell." As soon as Hussain heard this last farewell, he held his back. He recited a strange elegy, "Now my back is broken, Abbas. Now the grave is broken." O mourners, remember, in Arabic, there are several words for breaking. One word is "kasara." "Kasara" is used when something breaks in such a way that it cannot be repaired again. Hussain said, "Abbas, now the grave is broken in such a way that it cannot be repaired. Now my grave is broken. Abbas, now I can't see anything. Now I don't understand anything."

### Abbas's Last Will and Hussain's Farewell

And listen to my last sentence. He will read it. He says, "Abbas, the enemy is taunting. The enemy is taunting. Your standard-bearer has been killed. The one you were proud of has been killed." Saying this, Hussain reached Abbas. He reached the bank of the Euphrates. He took Abbas's head and placed it on his lap. Brother, brother, they talked for a while. Abbas made a will, "Master, do not take my funeral to the tent. Let my funeral remain here." And saying this, Abbas's eyes closed. Hussain then recited an elegy and said, "Abbas, now those eyes that used to stay awake due to your awe will now sleep in peace. Now the ladies will stay awake. Now the children will stay awake. Abbas, goodbye."
(لعنت اللہ علی القوم الظالمین)
