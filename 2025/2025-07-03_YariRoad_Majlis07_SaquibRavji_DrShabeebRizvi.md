### The Profound Significance of Sorrow for the Ahlul Bayt's Oppression

As for what follows, our Master and Chief, Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them), said:

`قال نفس المهموم لظلمنا تسبيح وهمه لنا عبادة وكتمان سرنا جهاد في سبيل الله`
He said: "The sigh of one grieved by our oppression is glorification [of Allah], his sorrow for us is worship, and concealing our secret is jihad in the way of Allah."
- [Reference needed]

Then Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them) said:

`يجب أن يكتب هذا الحديث بالذهب`
"This hadith must be written in gold."
- [Reference needed]

Our Master Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them) spoke the truth. Blessings. `صلوات` (Blessings).
اللهم صل على محمد وال محمد وعجل فرجهم والعن اعدائهم اجمعين. (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, hasten their relief, and curse all their enemies.)

This noble hadith has been chosen for this mourning gathering. In this noble hadith, Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them) says:

`"نفس المهموم لظلمنا تسبیح"`
"The sigh of one grieved by our oppression is glorification [of Allah]."
- [Reference needed]

#### Understanding the Hadith: Sigh, Sorrow, and Secrecy

Meaning, if someone hears about our oppression, about our being oppressed, and takes a deep sigh, feeling sorrow, then this deep sighing of his is `tasbeeh` (glorification of Allah). It is glorification of Allah. When he hears about our oppression and takes a deep sigh, meaning he pities the oppression of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them), just this sighing is glorification of Allah. It's amazing.

After that, he says:

`"وهمہ لنا عبادة"`
"And his sorrow for us is worship."
- [Reference needed]

And when he hears this sad news and becomes sorrowful, then this sorrow of his is worship. This sighing is `tasbeeh` and being sorrowful is worship.

And after that he says:

`"وکتمان سرنا جهاد فی سبیل الله"`
"And concealing our secret is jihad in the way of Allah."
- [Reference needed]

After that, the Imam (peace be upon them) says that it is obligatory that you write this hadith in gold. It is obligatory.

`"یجب أن یکتب هذا الحدیث بالذهب"`
"This hadith must be written in gold."
- [Reference needed]

It is obligatory that the hadith be written in gold. Meaning, writing it in gold means that it should be given great importance, so much importance that it should be given more importance than gold and silver are given.

What does this hadith tell us? This hadith tells us that we should consider the sorrow of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them) as our own sorrow, in fact, even greater than our own sorrow. We should be sorrowful in the grief of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them).

#### The Paramount Importance of Ahlul Bayt Remembrance

And every remembrance, that is, the remembrance of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them), is `tasbeeh`. It is worship. Remembering the calamities of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them). The Imam says that you should write it in gold.

Now, regarding the remembrance of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them), that is, this mourning gathering that we all hold. What is this mourning gathering? It is the remembrance of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them). It is the commemoration of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them). And there cannot be a better way to remember. One should first mention the virtues of the family of Muhammad (peace be upon them). After that, one should mention their calamities.

That is why there are many religious authorities among us whose classes, when seen, are religious classes, even in advanced seminary classes. When there is a 45-minute class, they don't do more than 45 or 50 minutes. They don't teach more than that. As soon as their lesson ends – not all religious authorities, but some, which we ourselves attended, he is telling, regularly – so, they have a person there, he is also a `Mawlana`. But as soon as the lesson ends, he recites the calamities of Sayyid al-Shuhada (Master of Martyrs) (peace be upon them). Or he recites the calamities of Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) (peace be upon him) or Lady Fatima (peace be upon them), it depends on what the date is. According to that date, he recites the calamities. This is the best method. And after that, when he recites the calamities after the lesson, then there is a prayer for the advent of Imam of our time (peace be upon him). How systematically they do everything. And that is why, then, in this, things have an effect.

### The Healing and Protective Power of Ahlul Bayt Remembrance

See, we present this narration in your service. That Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them) says:
اللہم صل علی محمد وال محمد و عجل فرجهم و العن اعدائهم اجمعین (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, hasten their relief, and curse all their enemies.)

#### "Our Remembrance is a Cure for Ailments"

The Imam says:

`"ذکرنا اہل البیت شفاء من العلل"`
"Our remembrance, the remembrance of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them), is a cure for ailments."
- [Reference needed]

Our remembrance of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them) is a cure for illnesses. Meaning, for heart diseases. Of course, it can also be physical. If one remembers the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them) and they wish to grant healing, they can grant healing. And we have seen many incidents, many cases where doctors gave up. The doctor gave up.

#### Personal Testimony: A Mother's Healing from Cancer

I want to tell you about this incident that happened with my own mother, where the doctor said, "She has cancer, and she will have to undergo chemotherapy." So we took her for chemo, and my mother, by the grace of Allah, is still alive. Her belief was very strong. The doctor said that no, she would have to undergo chemotherapy now. So we took her for chemo. As soon as they took her to the radiation room, just as they were taking her, such intense heat came out of the room that she started screaming. She said, "No, take me back. Take me home." So we said, "Oh, we tried very hard to convince her, 'Mom, this radiation is very necessary for you, please go.'" She said, "No!" She was screaming and created a scene inside the hospital. So we said, "What do we do now?" So we decided, "Let's just go back home." We apologized to the doctor, who said, "No problem, you can bring her next time, okay?" So we brought her home. So we tried to convince her at home that it was very important. She said, "No, you keep that to yourselves." When was this? This was in 2013.

And with them, we have a friend, whose mother-in-law passed away. Our friend is a doctor, and his daughter is also a doctor. And his mother-in-law, meaning his daughter's grandmother, both got cancer at the same time, and their treatment started at the same time. So our friend said, "See, we have to do everything very scientifically." He is a Muslim, but he was very... they were doctors, you see. Technically, "we have to do everything scientifically" and so on. So they started chemo. His mother-in-law died in two years, scientifically. My mother said, "We will go to our Doctor." Now believe me. My mother is still alive, by the grace of Allah. And she said, "We will go to our Doctor." This was around March-April, and at that time, no pilgrimage group was going, so we made a small group of our family members and said, "We just have to go to Karbala. We have to go to Karbala." We said, "Okay," and sent all the family members to Karbala. And in Karbala, she insisted that she would visit all the shrines from Najaf to Kadhimain and Samarra, even the shrines of the `Imamzadas` (descendants of Imams); she wouldn't miss any. She said, "We have to go there too." So we said, "Okay." Those of our family members, they know, we said, "Go, no shrine should be missed." They said, "Okay." So she went to every shrine and did her... she had throat cancer. Now she went there and simply sought healing from the Imam (peace be upon them). After that, she returned.

Now, when she returned, we took her to the cancer specialist, the one who is a cancer specialist. And he checked everything, had tests done, and then said, "No, there is no cancer at all. Absolutely not." We were all shocked, "Oh, how can this be?" And he is a Hindu doctor, Dr. Deshpande, a special oncologist. Inside Somaiya Hospital, he said, "Brother, it's just not there." So we showed him the report, we said, "Brother, look, we just had all this done, and she was under the treatment of Dr. Sultan Pradhan." He said, "No, brother, there is nothing at all." Then he said to Sultan Pradhan, "No, she is okay. She is perfectly alright." All praise is due to Allah. So when the doctor said that, we asked our mother, "Mom, do you want to ask the doctor anything?" So she said, "Yes, ask if I can eat `paan` (betel leaf)?" Recite one `salawat`.
اللهم صل على محمد وال محمد وعجل فرجهم والعن اعدائهم. (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, hasten their relief, and curse their enemies.)
So, can one eat `paan`? He said, "No, even if you don't have cancer, you shouldn't eat `paan`." `Paan` is not a good thing. Recite one more `salawat`. اللهم صل على محمد وال محمد وعجل فرجهم والعن اعدائهم اجمعين (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, hasten their relief, and curse all their enemies.)

No, the Imam says:

`"ذکرنا اهل البیت شفاء من العلل والأسقام"`
"Our remembrance, the remembrance of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them), is a cure for ailments and diseases."
- [Reference needed]

`Illat` means illness, and `saqam` also means illness. `Asqam` is the plural of `saqam`. `Saqam` means illness. And truly, if a person prays with trust and conviction, believe me, there is tremendous healing. Tremendous healing.

#### Protection from Doubts and Connection to Divine Pleasure

After that:

`"و وسواس الریب"`
"And the whispers of doubt."
- [Reference needed]

This remembrance of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them) protects a person from the whispers of `raib` (doubt). That is, when Satan puts doubt in the heart about belief, this remembrance of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them) protects from that doubt. If a person keeps reading hadiths and continuously remembers the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them), he will remain protected.

And after that he says:

`"وجهتنا رضى رب"`
"Our direction is the pleasure of the Lord."
- [Reference needed]

And our pleasure towards the Lord, what does it mean to turn towards us? It becomes a cause for Allah's pleasure. If someone turns towards us, then Allah's pleasure, Allah is pleased with him. That is why when you recite `Dua Tawassul` (prayer of intercession), you say:

`"یا وجیہاً عند اللہ"`
"O dignified one in the sight of Allah."
- [Reference needed]

So you are turning towards Allah through the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them); this is called `wajhatuna` (our direction). Meaning, to consider us as the Face of Allah, to understand us as Allah's Face, Allah's countenance. The Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them) is the Face of Allah.

`"نحن وجہ اللہ"`
"We are the Face of Allah."
- [Reference needed]

We are the Face of Allah. The Imam says:

`"الذي يتوجه اليه الاولياء"`
"Through whom the saints turn towards Him."
- [Reference needed]

That through this Face, people turn towards Allah. Allah has made them a Face.

#### The Exclusivity of `Hazirat al-Quds` (The Holy Presence)

`"والاخذ بأمرنا غدا فی حضرت القدس"`
"And adherence to our command [will lead to being] tomorrow in `Hazirat al-Quds` (the Holy Presence)."
- [Reference needed]

`Hazira` means compound. Compound. And `Quds` means holy, sacred. So there is a special enclosure in Paradise. A special, very large one, don't imagine it like an earthly compound, very large but it is exclusive. Exclusive. And it is only for them, it is only for the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them) and for those whom the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them) selects. `سبحان اللہ` (Glory be to Allah!) It's not for everyone.

That is why when the Imam asked Maytham, "Maytham, what will be your state when you are asked to renounce here?" Maytham said, "I will not." He said, "Do you know the outcome?" He said, "What?" He said, "You will be killed and crucified." Maytham said, "I will be a little patient, what's there in that?" This is just a little bit of calamity, isn't it? Murder and crucifixion. So do you know that Maytham hung on the cross for three days? He was alive for three days, and on the fourth day, blood started flowing from his nose. On the fourth day, this is a very big deal, it's not a small matter. The Imam (peace be upon them) said that if you are patient and do not renounce, then tomorrow in Paradise, you will be with me, in my rank. `سبحان اللہ سبحان اللہ` (Glory be to Allah! Glory be to Allah!) No, this is the status for everyone. And similarly, the Imam (peace be upon them) says that other companions of the Imams will also be with us in `Hazirat al-Quds` (the Holy Presence).

#### The Merit of Awaiting Imam al-Zaman (a.t.f.s.)

`والمُنتَظِرُ لأَمْرِنا`
"And the one who awaits our command."
- [Reference needed]

And the one who awaits our advent. The one who awaits the advent of Imam of our time (peace be upon him), tomorrow:

`مُتَشَحِّطٌ بِدَمِهِ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ`
will be as if bathed in his blood in the way of Allah.
- [Reference needed]

He is like one who is bathed in his blood in the way of Allah. Awaiting Imam of our time (peace be upon him) holds great importance; it is a very important thing. Day and night, Imam of our time (peace be upon him), that is, awaiting the Imam, so that one remembers the Imam day and night. One should remain in that thought of the Imam day and night, pray for the advent of the Imam day and night.

Believe me, that is, a man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family), this hadith is in `Al-Kafi` in `Kitab al-Dua` (Book of Supplication). He came and said that whatever deeds I do, whenever it happens, for example, 30% of it I pray for you. And then sometimes I pray 50% for you. When he was saying all this, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family) was listening silently to the same thing. He was just affirming him, saying, "You do well." Then at the end, he says that sometimes it happens that I don't pray for myself at all. I only pray for your sake, that's all. And I don't pray any other prayer, only for the sake of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them). That is, for example, like people pray for the advent nowadays. And they pray no other prayer, they don't ask for anything for themselves, they only pray for your sake. The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family) said, "If you do this, then all your prayers for this world and the hereafter will be answered." `सुभान अल्लाह` (Glory be to Allah!) Meaning if someone is giving preference. So whenever someone asks us for `iltimas-e-dua` (a request for prayer), one should tell him, "Brother, pray for the advent." If someone says, "We are going for `ziyarat` (pilgrimage)," tell him, "Pray for the advent." One should always pray for this advent. That is, when there is always concern for Imam of our time (peace be upon him), then a person will pray for the advent and will also make others pray. Recite one `salawat`.
اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ وَالْعَنْ أَعْدَاءَهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ. (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, hasten their relief, and curse all their enemies.)

### The Grave Consequence of Failing to Aid the Ahlul Bayt

After that, there's a somewhat dangerous sentence. The Imam (peace be upon them) says:

`مَن شَهِدَنا في حَربِنا`
"Whoever witnessed us in our war."
- [Reference needed]

Who sees us in our war, meaning sees us fighting, that we are fighting.

`أو سَمِعَ واعيَتَنا۔`
Or heard our call.
- [Reference needed]

Or if he hears that we are calling him for help. The cry of `هل من ناصر` (Is there any helper?), the cry of `هل من مغيث` (Is there any one to help?), the cry of `هل من ذاب` (Is there any defender?). When the Imams (peace be upon them) raise it, the Imam says that whoever hears that call,

`فلم ينصرنا`
but does not help us,
- [Reference needed]

`أكبه الله على منخريه في النار۔`
Allah will throw him headlong on his nostrils into the Fire.
- [Reference needed]

Allah will throw him face down into Hell. `منخريه` (His nostrils) is what this is called, these two nostrils of the nose are called `mankharayn` in Arabic. Meaning, face down like this, that is, Allah will throw them face down, from the central face, into Hell, who does not help the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them). He will not assist the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them). In whatever way he can assist, in whatever way he can help.

#### The Blessings of Small, Sincere Gatherings

For instance, this remembrance, this gathering, this is an assistance. This is an assistance to the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them). This remembrance, this inviting people, look, numbers don't matter. Our teacher used to always say that even if there are just one or two people, it can still be a gathering, and in that gathering, Lady Fatima (peace be upon them) might grace it with her presence, and the teacher would say there are blessings. And it's not necessary that a very large gathering should come to it. It's not necessary. What is the condition? That a person does it with sincerity. With sincerity, always, in everything. Believe me. That is, we are telling you this practical example, that oh, never go for numbers, and all this is present in hadith. When there are only two people and remembrance, it is an Arabic hadith, yes, Allama Majlisi has brought it in `Bihar al-Anwar`. Allama Majlisi has brought the hadith in `Bihar al-Anwar` and narrated that when there are only two people, the third is an angel. Wow, wow, wow! And then when that angel, when that gathering ends, when the angel starts to leave, such a fragrance comes from the angel's being that other angels ask, "Brother, where are you coming from?" So he says, "I am coming from a gathering of the remembrance of Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy family) and the family of Muhammad (peace be upon them)."
اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ وَالْعَنْ أَعْدَاءَهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ. (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, hasten their relief, and curse all their enemies.)
He says, "Now it's our chance to go." Oh, the gathering had ended. Anyway, the hadith is very long, but then those people say, "Okay, somehow we should get some reward, do something." Anyway, that hadith is very lengthy.

### The Ahlul Bayt as the Door to Succor and Salvation

So the Imam (peace be upon them) says:

`نحن بابُ الغَوثِ إذا بَغَوا وضاقَتِ المَذاهِبُ۔`
"We are the door of succor when they rebel and the paths become narrow."
- [Reference needed]

When there is `fitna` (strife) and `fasad` (corruption) and rebellion all around, and the paths are completely narrow, and no one knows what the way is. At that time, a person should seek refuge in us. We are the refuge of people. When a person doesn't understand. Many people, for us, by the grace of Allah, it's not very difficult, that is, understand. But for those who go to a higher station, the difficulties for them are greater. They say, there's a saying in Persian. They say that the bigger the roof of a house, the more snow accumulates on it. So the higher a person's rank, the greater his difficulties are. So in such a situation, there should be prayer.

`نحن بابُ الغَوثِ إذا بَغَوا وضاقَتِ المَذاهِبُ۔`
"We are the door of succor when they rebel and the paths become narrow."
- [Reference needed]

`نحن بابُ حِطَّةٍ وهُو بابُ السلام۔`
"We are the Gate of `Hittah` (remission) and it is the Gate of Peace."
- [Reference needed]

#### `Bab-e-Hittah` (Gate of Remission) and its Divine Significance

We are `Bab-e-Hittah`. Do you know what `Bab-e-Hittah` is? The Children of Israel, that was a gate about which Allah has made a Quranic verse in the Quran, that Allah commanded the Children of Israel to enter this gate:

`اُدخُلُوا البابَ سُجَّداً۔`
Enter the gate in prostration.
- Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:58)

When you enter this city, enter through that gate, it is called `Bab-e-Hittah`, enter in a state of prostration.

`اُدخُلُوا البابَ سُجَّداً۔`
Enter the gate in prostration.
- Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:58)

This is a verse from the Quran.

`وَقُولُوا حِطَّةٌ۔`
And say `hittatun` (remission).
- Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:58)

And you should say `hittatun`. When in a state of prostration, what should be the `dhikr` (remembrance of Allah)? `حِطَّةٌ۔` (`Hittatun`.)

`نَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطاياكُمْ۔`
We will forgive your sins.
- Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:58)

We will forgive all your sins. What is to be done? Prostrate, say `hittatun`, and just enter. It's a different matter that the Children of Israel didn't do it. But what did Allah tell them in the Quran? That just prostrate, say `hittatun`, and enter, and We will forgive all your sins. All past and present. Now, what is written in its `tafsir` (exegesis)? That on that gate was written `يا محمد يا علي۔` (O Muhammad, O Ali.) Wow, wow, wow! On it, Allah said, "Prostrate." And go on prostrating and keep saying `hittatun`. So you see, it's a verse from the Quran. Okay, suppose you don't believe anything was written, but at least Allah said, "Brother, prostrate before the gate and keep saying `hittatun`, and We will forgive all your sins." For such a small deed.

So if it is written in our hadith that after drinking a glass of water or a little water, say:

`صلواتُ اللهِ على الحسينِ، اللهمَّ العنْ قَتَلَةَ الحسينِ بِأَوْلادِهِ وأصحابِهِ۔`
May the blessings of Allah be upon Husayn; O Allah, curse the killers of Husayn along with his children and companions.
- [Reference needed]

If you just say this much, Allah will forgive all your sins. So why is there anything to be surprised about in this? You are surprised by it. How can this be? How can this be?

#### Reconciling Divine Forgiveness with Accountability

Now, some people here become a bit too holy. You know holy? Holier-than-thou. They are called `Muqaddas Numa` (pseudo-holy). Meaning, they are very holy, there's no one holier than them. There was `Muqaddas Ardabili` and then these others. `Agha` was born four hundred years later. They say, "Then what about that verse?

`فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُۥ وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُۥ۔`
So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it; and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.
- Quran, Surah Az-Zalzalah (99:7-8)

It's a verse from Surah Zilzal: Whoever does a good deed will see it, whoever does a bad deed will see it. We say, "Brother, it's fine." Anyway, besides this, there are other verses in the Quran. Look, we can cite many verses now. Right now, I only mentioned the `Bab-e-Hittah` verse. Beyond that, there's another verse:

`وَقُلْ لِعِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسْرَفُوا عَلَىٰ أَنْفُسِهِمْ لَا تَقْنَطُوا مِنْ رَحْمَةِ اللَّهِ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ جَمِيعًا إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْغَفُورُ الرَّحِيمُ۔`
And say, "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by committing sins], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful."
- Quran, Surah Az-Zumar (39:53)

O Prophet, say to My servants who have committed many sins.

`أسرفوا على أنفسهم۔`
They have transgressed against themselves.
- Quran, Surah Az-Zumar (39:53)

They have committed many sins, tell the very sinful ones not to despair of Allah's mercy, Allah will forgive all sins. He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. He is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. It's a verse from the Quran. Are you doubting the Quran? It's a verse from the Quran, read it in the Quran. So now, what is the difference between these two? In one place, Allah says Allah will forgive all sins. And in another place, He says He will take account of every single deed.

When Abu Basir came to Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them).
اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد وعجل فرجهم والعن اعدائهم اجمعين۔ (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, hasten their relief, and curse all their enemies.)
Abu Basir was very old. Exactly at that time when he came to the Imam (peace be upon them). He was taking deep sighs. Ah, and suddenly the Imam (peace be upon them) said, "What happened, Abu Basir? Why are you sighing so deeply?" So he said, "You know, I have become old. And my bones have also become very thin. Not much life is left. And I don't know what the outcome will be." The Imam (peace be upon them) said, "Abu Basir, will a person like you speak like this? Then what about others?" So he said, "Then what should I do if I don't do this? Tell me, I am thinking what will happen to me?" So the Imam (peace be upon them) recited several verses of the Quran for Abu Basir. And for every verse, the Imam (peace be upon them) said, "Abu Basir, this is for you." And after every verse, the Imam (peace be upon them) would then ask,

`فهل سررتكا يا ابا محمد؟`
"Have I made you happy, O Abu Muhammad?"
- [Reference needed]

"O Abu Muhammad, have I pleased you or not? Are you happy now?" So he said, "No, there's no obstinacy, tell me more." Among them, one verse was: "Tell the sinners that Allah will forgive all sins." The Imam (peace be upon them) said, "This is only for the Shiites. It is not for others." Allah will forgive all sins. And Allah is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful. This has been said by others, this by others, this is not for others, it is only for the Shiites.

`فهل سررتكا يا ابا محمد؟`
"Have I made you happy, O Abu Muhammad?"
- [Reference needed]

"Now have I made you happy or not?" He said, "Yes." "No obstinacy, tell me more and more verses." Oh, the Imam (peace be upon them) has a very great hadith. The Imam (peace be upon them) [recited] many verses of the Quran, and then what about this verse? What are they saying about this verse then? Every single deed. Whoever does a good deed will be accounted for, whoever does a bad deed will be accounted for. Yes, that is all for the opponents. Their every deed will be accounted for. They will be stopped, they won't be allowed to go further. If they did many good deeds, but if there is no `Wilayat` (guardianship/love), then they will be immediately stopped at `Pul-e-Sirat` (the bridge over hell).

#### The Centrality of `Wilayat` (Guardianship) in Accountability

The Quran says:

`قِفُوهُمْ`
"Stop them!"
- Quran, Surah As-Saffat (37:24)

"Stop them!"

`إِنَّهُمْ مَسْئُولُونَ۔`
Indeed, they are to be questioned.
- Quran, Surah As-Saffat (37:24)

They will be questioned. Where are they going? In the `tafsir` (exegesis) of this verse, prominent Sunni commentators have written in their books. Like Fakhr al-Razi also wrote:

`مسئولونَ عن ولايةِ عليِّ بنِ أبي طالبٍ عليهِ الصلاةُ والسلامُ۔`
They will be questioned about the `Wilayat` (guardianship) of Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), peace and blessings be upon him.
- [Reference needed, e.g., Tafsir al-Kabir by Fakhr al-Razi, under Surah As-Saffat (37:24)]

اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد وعجل فرجهم والعن اعدائهم اجمعين۔ (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, hasten their relief, and curse all their enemies.)
They will be asked about `Wilayat`: "How are you going like this, brother?" Prayer is done, fasting is done, Hajj is all done. They performed `Tarawih` (supererogatory prayers) well by slapping their hands. But they won't be able to move forward. And then after that, they will be thrown straight into Hell, face down. They have no place except, why? There is no `Wilayat`. And the matter is absolutely clear. Brother, whoever does not have `Wilayat`, he is sitting there.

`هَٰذَا لِي وَهَٰذَا لَكَ۔`
This is for me, and this is for you.
- [Reference needed, possibly referring to a hadith about Imam Ali's role at the Bridge]

Wow, wow, wow. This is for me, this is for you. Meaning, in the middle, the Master of the Universe, Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) (peace be upon him), is sitting. On this side is Paradise, on that side is Hell. So where the Master of the Universe (Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) (peace be upon him)) saw, "This is a Shia." "Come here." "Go, go here." And those who see, "Ah, this is a `Tarawih` person." "Go here." So he won't be able to go at all. It will not be possible for him. The Master will say, "Hell. This is for you, go." They will throw them in till the very end, this is a verse from the Quran. It is written in the Quran that Hell will say,

`هل امتلأت؟`
Are you full?
- Quran, Surah Qaf (50:30)

Meaning Allah will ask, truly, the Master of the Universe (Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) (peace be upon him)) will ask. Are you full? So they will ask, "Is there any more Sunni?"

`هل من مزيد؟`
Is there any more?
- Quran, Surah Qaf (50:30)

This is a verse from the Quran. We are not saying this, it is a verse from the Quran.

`هل امتلأت؟`
Are you full?
- Quran, Surah Qaf (50:30)

Have you become full? So Hell will ask,

`هل من مزيد؟`
Is there any more?
- Quran, Surah Qaf (50:30)

meaning, "Bring more." Hell will expand so much, Paradise will complain. Paradise will complain. O Lord, You have filled Hell? There is a lot of space here. Freehold land. There's no one at all, what to do? So it is written in hadith that when Paradise complains, Allah will create such beings who have never seen the world. Aha, wow. And He will send them directly to Paradise. So that He fulfills what Paradise is asking for. Recite one `salawat`.
اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد وعجل فرجهم والعن اعدائهم اجمعين۔ (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, hasten their relief, and curse all their enemies.)
So this is it, meaning the importance of `Wilayat` has been seen.

So the Imam (peace be upon them) says, "We are `Bab-e-Hittah` and it is the Gate of Peace, and this is the door of salvation."

`مَن دَخَلَه نَجَا۔`
Whoever enters it will be saved.
- [Reference needed]

Whoever entered `Bab-e-Hittah` will attain salvation.

`و مَن تَكَلَّفَ عنه هَوَىٰ۔`
And whoever turns away from it will perish.
- [Reference needed]

And whoever lagged behind, he was destroyed, he was annihilated, finished. There is no question of him being saved. Whoever doubts the `Wilayat` of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them) even an atom's weight, even an atom's weight. He is destroyed. Finished.

After that, he says:

`بنا يفتح الله۔`
Through us Allah initiates.
- [Reference needed]

Through us Allah initiates.

`و بنا يختم الله۔`
And through us Allah concludes.
- [Reference needed]

And through us, Allah will bring this world, this existence, this entire system of the universe to an end. From us it was set in motion, and through us this world, this universe, will end.

`و بنا يمحو ما يشاء و بنا يثبت۔`
And through us He erases what He wills and through us He establishes what He wills.
- [Reference needed]

And through us, Allah will erase destinies and write other destinies in their place. This is called `bada'`. Meaning, `bada'` will also happen through us.

### The Concept of `Bada'` (Divine Alteration of Destiny)

What does `bada'` mean? `Bada'` means the changing of destinies. Look, for Allah, there are two books. One is called `Umm al-Kitab` (Mother of the Book), and the other is called `Ilm al-Kitab` (Knowledge of the Book). And there are many hadiths in this regard. Allama Majlisi has also brought a whole chapter, Sheikh Kulayni has brought it in his book `Al-Kafi`. Much discussion, there is a lot in narrations. In it is written:

`إن لله علمين۔`
Indeed, for Allah are two knowledges.
- [Reference needed, e.g., Usul al-Kafi, Kitab al-Hujjah]

For Allah there are two ways of knowledge. What is one? The knowledge which is `Umm al-Kitab`, and one is `Ilm al-Kitab`. So this `Ilm al-Kitab`, in this, `bada'`, in this, Allah makes changes. Everything in this. The original `Umm al-Kitab`, everything is written in it with changes. For example, if a person, his age, for example, is 40 years. He is going to die at 40 years of age. So in `Ilm al-Kitab`, which is `Ilm al-Kitab`, 40 is written in it. But in it, what is written in `Umm al-Kitab`? That his age is 60 years. Why 60 years? Here 40 is written, there 60 is written. Because when he is about to die at 40 years, a little before that, a day or two before, he will perform `silat al-rahim` (maintaining kinship ties). When he performs `silat al-rahim`, Allah will increase his age by 20 years. Or he will give charity. Or he will do some such work by which Allah will erase the 40 from his age and write 60. So for this `Umm al-Kitab`, it is also called `Lawh` (tablet). `Lawh Mahw wa Ithbat` (Tablet of Erasing and Affirming). In this, Allah erases destinies.
اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد وعجل فرجهم۔ (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their relief.) For Allah is `Bada'`.

This is a very important belief. And this is a special belief of the Shiites. Although it is mentioned in the Quran. It is mentioned in the Quran, you recited this verse of Surah Ra'd:

`يَمْحُو اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ وَيُثْبِتُ وَعِندَهُ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ`
Allah erases what He wills or confirms [what He wills], and with Him is the Mother of the Book.
- Quran, Surah Ar-Ra'd (13:39)

This is a verse from Surah Ra'd. It is duly mentioned in it. And besides this, there are other incidents in the Quran. The turning away of the punishment from the people of Prophet Yunus (peace be upon him). When they repented and sought forgiveness, Allah averted the punishment. What does averting mean? It was destined before, but after prayer, it was averted. Similarly, answering the prayer of the Children of Israel and there are many such proofs, that is a separate topic. That is why we are putting this in your mind so that you remember that it is written in hadith that:

`مَا عُظِّمَ اللَّهُ بِشَيْءٍ مِثْلَ الْبَدَاءِ`
Allah is not glorified by anything like `Bada'`.
- [Reference needed, e.g., Usul al-Kafi, Kitab al-Tawhid]

`مَا عُبِدَ اللَّهُ بِشَيْءٍ مِثْلَ الْبَدَاءِ`
Allah is not worshipped by anything like `Bada'`.
- [Reference needed, e.g., Usul al-Kafi, Kitab al-Tawhid]

The worship of Allah that occurs through `Bada'` does not happen through anything else. The glorification of Allah, meaning the acknowledgment of His greatness, that occurs through `Bada'` does not happen through anything else. The belief in `Bada'`, meaning the belief in `Bada'` that Allah can do anything at any time.

`قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ الْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي الْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَاءُ وَتَنزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَاءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَاءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَاءُ بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ إِنَّكَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ`
Say, "O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand is [all] good. Indeed, You are over all things competent."
- Quran, Surah Ali 'Imran (3:26)

We always say one thing, we always say this to children: That remember, in the court of Allah, how is the entire universe for Allah? It's like a march is going on. Understand it. Understand that a march is going on. Just like a march, you see, so in a march, when the commander gives an order, he says, "About turn." As soon as he says, "About turn," what happens? The one who was at the very front becomes the one at the very back. Allah, whenever He wills, can complete anyone like this in an instant. And he doesn't even know what his state will be. That is why a person should never be arrogant or proud. When Allah will change someone's destiny, we cannot say anything. Is it clear for you? This is a very big topic, a very important topic because many people here also don't understand it. Especially those people who follow philosophy among us, they say that actually there is no change at all. They say there is no change at all. No, this is wrong. The Quran is saying there is change. The Quran is saying, and you people say there is no change. The Quran says `يَمْحُو اللَّهُ` (Allah erases). Allah erases.

`يَمْحُو اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ وَيُثْبِتُ`
Allah erases what He wills and establishes what He wills.
- Quran, Surah Ar-Ra'd (13:39)

And He writes in its place, Allah writes this. People say, "No, He doesn't write, He doesn't erase; this is just figurative," there are many such things, anyway.

#### The Ahlul Bayt as the Channel for Divine Changes

So the Imam (peace be upon them) says that through us destinies change. Look, pay attention to the sentence. Through us destinies change.

`وَبِنَا يَرْفَعُ اللَّهُ زَمَانَ الْكَرْبِ`
And through us Allah removes the time of distress.
- [Reference needed]

It's amazing. Through us, Allah keeps away very bad times from our Shiites. Remember, a very bad time. No matter how bad the time is. `Zaman` (time), if they say `kalb` in Arabic, meaning a very bad time. Meaning, there cannot be a worse time than that. Like this: a very bad time came in the whole world. For example, you just saw how Covid came. You saw what the conditions were like. Meaning, how worried people were. But anyway, you saw that in that situation, `majalis` (gatherings) were being held. And here it was still less. If you were to go to Lucknow etc., in Lucknow, the `Imambarahs` were completely packed, as if nothing. No Covid, no one wearing masks. Nothing at all. Just like that, and the `matam` (mourning) was happening vigorously. It was raining torrentially. And no one got Covid, no one died, no one survived, nothing. Others were dying. And dead bodies were floating on top in the Ganges. Some were even drowning them, oh, some were even taking them to burn, and here... It's not that deaths didn't happen among Shiites. They did. But it happened to those who stayed at home because of Covid and didn't go to `azadari` (mourning ceremonies). They died, and for those who went, not a single person's news came that he suffered anything like that. This means we are giving an example. And there are many such multiple examples. That if, but in that, there should be trust in the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them). There should be strong adherence to the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them).

`وَبِنَا يَنزِلُ الْغَيْثُ`
And through us the rain descends.
- [Reference needed]

Through us rain falls. Blessings come from the sky. Through us Allah has made us a means. That is why when Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi asked Qanbar, "Is Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) your Master?" So Qanbar replied, "My Master is Allah. And Allah has made Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) my `Wali Ni'mat` (guardian of blessings)." He has made him the means of my blessings. That is, in one sentence, Qanbar gave two answers. It was a very striking answer. He said, "Is Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) your Master?" that Allah is the Master, Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) is the `Wali Ni'mat`. The `Wali` of blessings, Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin). Here, see the answer from the servant of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them), Qanbar, what a great personality!

### Admonition Against Deception and the Virtue of Humility

After that, the Imam (peace be upon them) says:

`فَلَا يَغُرَّنَّكُم بِاللَّهِ الْغَرُورُ`
So let not the deceiver deceive you concerning Allah.
- Quran, Surah Luqman (31:33)

Look, never show arrogance before Allah with anything, that is, before Allah. Meaning, let nothing deceive you in comparison to Allah. Before Allah, let nothing of this world deceive you. It is the work of this world to deceive. This world deceives. That is why never fall for its deception. Always remember this. Always remain humble and submissive before Allah. It is a very important thing. A person should always be completely humble and submissive before Allah, His Messenger, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him and his holy family), and his Imam of the time, Imam of our time (peace be upon him).

### The Unparalleled Blessing of Ahlul Bayt Love

And in the way you all continue to hold these mourning gatherings. May Allah increase your success. Amen. May He accept your hard work. Amen. This is truly a very great act of worship. Among the `Sha'air Allah` (Signs of Allah), there is no better sign than this. `Sha'ar` means sign, symbol. This mourning gathering is among the signs of Allah. And it is written in the Quran:

`وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ شَعَائِرَ اللَّهِ فَإِنَّهَا مِن تَقْوَى الْقُلُوبِ`
And whoever honors the symbols of Allah - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts.
- Quran, Surah Al-Hajj (22:32)

Whoever honors the `Sha'air Allah`. This is a sign of the purity of his heart. And that is why the Imam (peace be upon them) says that Allah only chooses those people for our love whose birth is pure. Only those people, not everyone. That is why in the night's gathering, this point was emphasized greatly: That look, this `Wilayat` (guardianship) of the Holy Prophet's family (peace be upon them) is not something that is distributed freely on the streets. Don't think that. If Allah has given you the grace to come and sit in a mourning gathering, to sit on the mourning carpet, and to weep for the son of Lady Fatima (peace be upon them), then this is a very great blessing. A very great blessing; there is no greater blessing than this. There is no greater blessing than this. Therefore, never let it go from your hands. Never let it go from your hands. So that is why, always give it great importance and keep advising each other for this, so that this series never ends, although among us it will never end. But if, when we speak, we become participants in that reward. And that is why you see, in Karbala, the people who came, whoever came for the help of Sayyid al-Shuhada (Imam Hussein) (peace be upon them), what kind of individuals were they, about whom no one knew? Very few, one or two, you will find such who were, that is, those `Muhajirun` (emigrants) and `Ansar` (helpers), big companions, very few, very few you will find. Such people won't be found in Karbala at all. In Karbala, everyone was such that no one knew them. Very few individuals were very famous and well-known. There were no big people at all. As many big names you see in history, none were in Karbala. No one came to help Imam Hussein (peace be upon them). Only those whom Allah chose, only they came. Those whom Imam Sadiq (peace be upon them) called:

`السَّلَامُ عَلَیْکُمْ یَا أَنْصَارَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ`
Peace be upon you, O helpers of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy family).
- [Reference needed]

Peace be upon you, O helpers and supporters of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him and his holy family). It's a very great thing.

### The Calamity of Sayyiduna Qasim ibn Hassan (peace be upon them)

So today, it has become the 7th of Muharram. And today's date is attributed to Ali Akbar (peace be upon them). That is why we recite the calamities of Ali Akbar (peace be upon them). It is attributed to Qasim (peace be upon them), we recite the calamities of Qasim (peace be upon them). And this boy, this young boy of 13 years old, so Sayyid al-Shuhada (Imam Hussein) (peace be upon them) asked him, "Son Qasim, how do you find death?" So what does this young man reply, think about it. He says:

`أَحْلَى مِنَ الْعَسَلِ`
Sweeter than honey.
- [Reference needed]

Sweeter than honey. Sweeter than honey.

#### Imam Hassan's Will and Qasim's Insistence

But on the night of Ashura, when Imam Hussein (peace be upon them) began to read the `mahzar-e-shahadat` (document of martyrdom) with the names of the martyrs, he did not take Qasim's (peace be upon them) name in it. So the child went to a corner and was weeping. While weeping, he remembered that when his father, Imam Hassan (peace be upon them), was leaving this world, his father said, "Son Qasim, if any great calamity befalls, then tie this amulet on your hand." As soon as Qasim (peace be upon them) opened the amulet, what did he see written in it?

`بُنَیَّ قَاسِم`
My dear son Qasim,
- [Reference needed]

you had written, "Son Qasim, help your uncle Imam Hussein (peace be upon them). Sacrifice yourself for him. If he does not give permission, keep insisting until he gives permission. Keep asking until he gives permission." Qasim (peace be upon them). Qasim (peace be upon them) came. He stood before Imam Hussein (peace be upon them) with the writing. Imam Hussein (peace be upon them) looked at the writing, tears came to his eyes, he cried, weeping. Once he looked at Qasim (peace be upon them) from head to toe and said, "Son Qasim, this is not your brother's writing; you have brought the message of your own death." He said, "Uncle, it is my father's command." He said, "Son Qasim, I know tomorrow is the day of martyrdom; everyone has to go. Everyone has to die. I only did not mention you, otherwise, son Qasim, not only you will be martyred tomorrow, but your brother Ali Asghar (peace be upon them) will also be martyred." So, on one hand, Qasim (peace be upon them) was happy that his martyrdom was mentioned, brother, but on the other hand, the honorable one of Bani Hashim became worried: "How will my brother Ali Asghar (peace be upon them) be martyred?" He immediately asked,

`یَا أُمَّاهُ هَلْ یَسِیرُونَ إِلَى الْخِیَامِ`
"O my mother, will they march towards the tents?"
- [Reference needed]

meaning, "Will the wicked come to the tents?" Imam Hussein (peace be upon them) reassured him that no, Qasim (peace be upon them), the wicked will not come to the tents. I will take Ali Asghar (peace be upon them) to the battlefield, the field of combat. Hearing this, Qasim (peace be upon them) felt a little reassured, he felt comforted. I will say, "O honorable youth of Bani Hashim, hearing this much, you became restless." Oh, just ask Imam Ali Zayn al-Abidin (peace be upon them), on the evening of Ashura, the wicked entered the tents, and they left Imam Ali Zayn al-Abidin (peace be upon them) in tears.

#### The Tragic Martyrdom of Qasim (peace be upon them)

The morning of Ashura came, and the series of martyrdoms began, until after Dhuhr, the series of martyrdoms of Bani Hashim began. Once, when the series of martyrdoms of the children of Imam Hassan (peace be upon them) began, Qasim (peace be upon them) came and stood in front. "Uncle, please permit me. Uncle, please permit me now. Uncle, please permit me." Imam Hussein (peace be upon them) stood silent. In the `Maqtal` (narrative of martyrdom), there is a strange perplexity. That Qasim (peace be upon them) once took both of Imam Hussein's (peace be upon them) hands and began to rub them on his eyes. "Uncle, please permit me. Uncle, please permit me." Imam Hussein (peace be upon them) said, "Son, now you have to go. I permit you." Imam Hussein (peace be upon them) prepared Qasim (peace be upon them). After preparing, both uncle and nephew embraced each other. It is written in the `Maqtal` that they both wept so much, cried so much, cried so much that both fainted. O mourners, tell me fairly, when someone faints, water is sprinkled to bring them back to consciousness. But alas for the helplessness of Lady Zaynab (peace be upon them). Tears were sprinkled. Tears were sprinkled. When both regained consciousness, Lady Zaynab (peace be upon them) said, "Brother, let Qasim (peace be upon them) go." Imam Hussein (peace be upon them) mounted Qasim (peace be upon them), or as he was going, he once tore his collar, saying, "Uncle, how is this?" This is a sign of orphans. This is a sign of orphans. Qasim (peace be upon them) went to the battlefield and kept fighting. While fighting, once a wicked person attacked Qasim (peace be upon them) in such a way. Qasim (peace be upon them) fell from the horse, but did not fall completely, as his shoe got stuck in the stirrup. Qasim (peace be upon them) fell from the horse, Qasim (peace be upon them) put his hands around the horse's neck. As a result, the horse became so agitated that it took Qasim (peace be upon them) among the wicked. The wicked began to cut Qasim (peace be upon them) with their swords. The wicked once trampled Qasim's (peace be upon them) body. The wicked once trampled Qasim (peace be upon them) with their horses. Qasim's (peace be upon them) hands were shattered into pieces. Qasim (peace be upon them) cried out, "Uncle, come for help!" Imam Hussein (peace be upon them) ran when Qasim (peace be upon them) breathed his last. Imam Hussein (peace be upon them) collected Qasim's (peace be upon them) body in pieces and answered his father (Imam Hassan (peace be upon them)). And took that small bundle home. May Allah bless...

`وَسَيَعْلَمُ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا أَيَّ مُنقَلَبٍ يَنقَلِبُونَ`
And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned.
- Quran, Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:227)

May Allah's curse be upon the oppressors. O Lord, hasten the advent of Imam of our time (peace be upon him). Amen. O Master, hasten the advent of Imam of our time (peace be upon him). Amen. `یا بقیۃ اللہ فی العالمین` (O Remnant of Allah in the worlds), hasten the advent. Amen. O Master, perfect our helpers. Amen. O Master, increase our sustenance. Amen. Those who are in debt, make them pay off their debts. Amen. O Master, grant us righteous and pious generations. Amen. Those who are sick, grant them complete healing. Amen. `یا علی حیدر کرار` (O Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), the Charging Lion), wherever they are in the world, protect their lives, wealth, honor, and dignity. Amen. O Master, protect our scholars and esteemed religious authorities. Amen. Protect the holy shrines. Amen. Those who are protecting them, then protect them. Amen. Especially protect the shrine of Lady Zaynab (peace be upon them). Amen. Those who are protecting her, then protect them. Amen. O Lord, accept this meager mourning. Amen. O Lord, honor you in this world with the `ziyarat` (pilgrimage/visitation) of Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy family) and the family of Muhammad (peace be upon them), and in the hereafter with the intercession of Muhammad (peace be upon him and his holy family) and the family of Muhammad (peace be upon them). Amen. O Master Hussein (peace be upon them). O Hussein (peace be upon them).
