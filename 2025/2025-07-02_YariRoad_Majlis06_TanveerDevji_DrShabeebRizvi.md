### Introduction to the Hadith: Imam Husayn's Noble Welcome

Our master and leader, Imam Husayn, son of Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, narrated a significant tradition. Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, stated:

`قال لي رسول الله`
(The Messenger of Allah)
- [Reference needed]

peace be upon him and his holy family, said to me:

`مرحبا بك يا ابا عبد الله يا زين السماوات والارضين`
("Welcome, O Aba Abdillah, O adornment of the heavens and the earths!")
- [Reference needed]

This chosen hadith, brief for this gathering, is narrated by Sayyid al-Shuhada (the Master of Martyrs) himself. He recounts that he was with the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, when Ubayy ibn Ka'b, a very great and prominent companion of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, was present. Ubayy ibn Ka'b is known for narrating many hadiths from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, especially concerning the virtues of reciting each surah of the Qur'an. He was a very good companion.

Sayyid al-Shuhada states that when he presented himself before the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, and Ubayy ibn Ka'b was sitting there, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, addressed Imam Husayn and said:

`مرحبا بک یا ابا عبداللہ`
("Welcome, O Aba Abdillah.")
- [Reference needed]

#### The Meaning of "Marhaba" and "Kunya"

There are two significant aspects in this greeting. Firstly, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, used `مرحبا` (marhaba), which means "welcome" in Arabic. `مرحبا بک` (marhaba bik) is known as `ترہیب` (tarhib) in Arabic, signifying a heartfelt welcome.

Secondly, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, addressed Imam Husayn, his grandson, by his `kunya` (agnomen): `یا ابا عبداللہ` (Ya Aba Abdillah). In Arabic culture, using a `kunya` is a sign of respect. If respect is not intended, only the given name is used. For example, one might say, `علی تعال` (Ali, come), which implies familiarity rather than respect, such as when addressing a friend. Conversely, if Arabs do not know someone or wish to show respect, they first inquire about their `kunya`, asking `ابا من؟` (Aba man? - Whose father are you?), meaning, "What is your `kunya`?" Once informed, for instance, "Abu Ali," they would then address the person respectfully as `یا ابا الحسن` (Ya Aba al-Hasan). This practice is deeply rooted in Arab culture as a mark of reverence.

This is exemplified by an incident during the time of Umar, `لعنت اللہ علیہ` (May Allah's curse be upon him). A man filed a case against Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, alleging wrongdoing. Umar, who was greatly intimidated by Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, addressed him within the courtroom by his `kunya`, `یا ابا الحسن` (O Aba al-Hasan), asking for his opinion on the matter. Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, immediately rebuked him, stating, "You are the judge at this moment. As a judge, do not address me with respect, otherwise your inclination will be towards one side; your tendency, your inclination, will be towards one side. Call both parties by their names equally." He emphasized, "Refer to both parties equally. Your inclination should not be towards one side." Umar acknowledged his mistake, saying, "Yes, I made a mistake, sorry, sorry," highlighting his recurrent errors.

#### The Prophet's Awe-Inspiring Titles for Imam Husayn

The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, continued to address Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, saying: `مرحبا بک یا ابا عبداللہ` (Welcome, O Aba Abdillah). Then, he added, `یا زین السماوات والارضین` (O adornment of the heavens and the earths!). This is a profound title for Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, indicating that he is the cause of adornment, indeed, the beauty, of all heavens and all earths. Husayn ibn Ali is the source of beauty for the heavens and for all earths. This reveals his immense rank and station.

Ubayy ibn Ka'b, naturally, did not have the capacity to comprehend such profound statements. Upon hearing this, he became perturbed and asked:

`و کیف یکون یا رسول اللہ زین السماوات والارضون والعرض احد غیرک؟`
(And how can anyone other than you, O Messenger of Allah, be the adornment of the heavens and the earths?)
- [Reference needed]

Ubayy, with no ill intention, simply questioned how anyone else could be the adornment besides the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, whom he revered deeply. He understood the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, to be the ultimate adornment. Furthermore, Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, was still a child at that time, and yet the Prophet was introducing him with such immense respect, stating he was the "adornment of the heavens and the earth."

The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, responded, `یا ابی` (O Ubayy), and swore by Allah:

`والذی بعثنی بالحق نبیا`
(By Him who sent me as a Prophet with the truth),
- [Reference needed]

adding:

`ان الحسین ابن علی فی السماء اکبر منہ فی الارض`
(Verily, Husayn ibn Ali is greater in the heavens than he is on earth).
- [Reference needed]

This means that Husayn's status in the heavens is significantly higher than it is on earth. The people of the earth do not appreciate Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, as much as he deserves, or as much as the dwellers of the heavens do. We, as humans, do not fully appreciate Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, to the extent of his true worth.

### The Divine Status of Imam Husayn as Revealed in the Heavens

Following this, the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, revealed more about Imam Husayn's divine status:

`فانہ لمکتوب عن یمین عرش اللہ`
(For indeed, it is written on the right side of Allah's Throne).
- [Reference needed]

It is written on the right side of Allah's Throne that Husayn is:

#### "A Lamp of Guidance" (Mishbah Huda)

Husayn is `مصباح هدی` (a lamp of guidance). This means that whoever comes close to Husayn, peace be upon him, becomes guided. Such a person will never stumble. Whoever remains close to Husayn, peace be upon him, will become acquainted with all truths, knowing what is right and what is wrong, provided they maintain their proximity to Husayn ibn Ali. This is the essence of `مصباح هدى` (lamp of guidance).

#### "A Ship of Salvation" (Safinat Najat)

And Husayn ibn Ali is `سفینۃ نجاه` (a ship of salvation). This implies that whoever boards Husayn's ship is saved and will be saved. There is no way for such a person to perish; they are secure. One merely needs to hold onto the hem of Husayn ibn Ali. Of course, there are conditions.

The condition for being aboard Husayn ibn Ali's ship means remaining with the twelve Imams. One must hold the Twelver belief, a correct Twelver belief, and additionally, one must have `bara'at` (disassociation) alongside `walayah` (allegiance). Without `bara'at` (disassociation) or `tabarra` (disavowal), a person's belief, though they may believe in Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, is not truly correct. Our belief does not allow for a mix of "these are good, and those are also good." It's not like decorating vases with thorns alongside flowers. The reality is that one is either on this side or on that side. This is not merely our belief; it is a verse from the Qur'an, specifically verse number four of Surah Al-Ahzab:

`ما جعل اللہ لرجل من قلبین فی جوفہ`
(Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his chest).
- [33:4]

Allah states in Surah Al-Ahzab that He does not place two hearts in any human being; every human has only one heart. Thus, there can only be room for one side. In the exegesis of this verse, the Imam says: If someone has the love of Allah, then the love of Satan cannot be in their heart. If someone has the love of Adam in their heart, then the love of Satan cannot be in their heart. If someone has the love of Abel (Habil) in their heart, then the love of Cain (Qabil) cannot be in their heart. If someone has the love of Abraham in their heart, then the love of Nimrod cannot be there. If someone has the love of Moses, then the love of Pharaoh cannot be there. In this way, the Imam states that if someone has the love of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, in their heart, then the love of Abu Jahl cannot be there. And if someone has the love of Commander of the Faithful, son of Abi Talib, in their heart, then the love of Abu Bakr cannot be there.

#### "Imam of Goodness and Abundance" (Imam Khayr wa Yam)

So, Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, is `سفینۃ نجاۃ` (the ship of salvation), and he is also `و امام خیر و یم` (And Imam of goodness and abundance). Husayn is `امام خیر` (Imam of goodness), the Imam of all goodness. If someone desires goodness, they should come to Husayn's door. And `Yam` (abundance) means blessing. If someone wants blessings, they should come to Imam Husayn's, peace be upon him, door.

We present a very important point: whoever spends anything for the sake of Husayn ibn Ali, remember that Husayn ibn Ali returns many times more than that. Believe it. Most people, in their passion, say this: "We are ready to sell our house for Husayn. We will sell our houses for Husayn's `azadari` (mourning rituals)." But has there ever been a single house sold for the sake of Husayn ibn Ali? People give everything, but Husayn ibn Ali returns many times more. This is from experience; you can see and experience it for yourself.

#### "Honor and Pride" (Izz wa Fakhr)

Thus, Husayn embodies `خیر و یم` (goodness and abundance), and also `و عز و فخر` (and honor and pride). Husayn is the Imam of honor. This means, whoever follows Husayn will gain honor. And whoever is associated with Husayn, for them it will be a source of pride and honor. It is a matter of pride to say, "I am of Husayn, we are Husaynis." This is a source of pride. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, is saying that the effect of Husayn's name is such that whoever connects with Husayn, Allah will automatically bestow pride upon him. Allah will make Husayn a source of pride for him; He will make him a cause of pride.

#### "A Sea of Knowledge and a Treasure" (Bahr Ilm wa Dhukhr)

And then the Prophet says: `و بحر علم` (And a sea of knowledge). Husayn is a sea of knowledge. And `و ذخر` (And a treasure). And Husayn is that treasure that will never run out; this treasure will never diminish.

This is why the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, said in another hadith:

`ان لقتل الحسین حرارۃ فی قلوب المؤمنین لا تبردو ابدا`
(Verily, for the martyrdom of Husayn, there is a warmth in the hearts of the believers that shall never cool down).
- [Reference needed]

For Husayn, there is such a warmth in the hearts of believers that it will never cool down. This fire, this flame, that is in the hearts of believers for Husayn ibn Ali, will never cool down. The only condition is that one must simply have faith. If there is faith, then it is impossible for them not to connect with Husayn ibn Ali. These are all the words of the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family.

### The Prophetic Supplication and its Profound Benefits

Now, consider this strange and wonderful hadith. After that, the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, said:

`ولقد لقن دعوات ما یدعو بہن مخلوق الا حشر اللہ عز وجل معہ`
(And indeed, he was taught supplications by which no creature supplicates but that Allah, the Exalted and Glorified, resurrects him with him).
- [Reference needed]

And then the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, teaches a supplication. If someone recites this supplication, then on the Day of Judgment, he will be resurrected with Husayn ibn Ali.

When Ubayy ibn Ka'b heard this, he asked, "O Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family." The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, further elaborated:

`وکان شفیعہ فی آخرتہ`
(And he will be his intercessor in his afterlife).
- [Reference needed]

Husayn ibn Ali will be his intercessor in the afterlife if someone recites this supplication. Husayn will intercede for him. Just imagine if Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, intercedes for someone; then his life and his afterlife are guaranteed. `شفیع فی اخرتہ` (Intercessor in his afterlife).

#### Benefits for This Life and the Hereafter

Beyond intercession, the benefits extend to this life:

`و فرج اللہ عنہ کربہ`
(And Allah will relieve his distress).
- [Reference needed]

Whoever recites this supplication, Allah will remove all his difficulties and worries.

`و قضی بہا دینہ`
(And through it, He will settle his debts).
- [Reference needed]

If he is in debt or has taken a loan, Allah will pay off his debts.

`و یسر امرہ`
(And He will ease his affairs).
- [Reference needed]

Look, we are talking about just one supplication, a supplication related to Imam Husayn, peace be upon him. Allah will make all his affairs easy. Whatever matters he has in his life, Allah will make them easy and facilitate everything for him, so that all his issues and problems are resolved with ease.

`و اوضح سبیلہ`
(And He will make his path clear).
- [Reference needed]

And Allah will make his path so clear for him that he will know which way to go. The only condition is that he remains connected to Husayn ibn Ali. The condition is connection to the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them. He should simply keep seeking their intercession. His path will automatically be made clear; he doesn't need to do anything. He just needs to keep saying, `یا اہل البیت` (O Family of the Holy Prophet!). "O Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them, I know nothing. I only know you; you show the way. That's it." And they will continue to show the way.

The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, further stated:

`أَوْضَحَ سَبِیلَہُ وَقَوَّاهُ عَلَى عَدُوِّهِ`
(He made his path clear and strengthened him against his enemies).
- [Reference needed]

And Allah will strengthen him against his enemies. He will make him strong in the face of his enemies, and the enemies will be weak before him. This is because there will be divine power. Just as Allah helped the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, everywhere and at every stage, similarly, with Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, and with other Imams, peace be upon them. We see how Allah strengthened them. Likewise, believers who are connected to the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them, never care about the world. Never. Whether the world is with them or not, who is there or not, this is there or not, that is there or not – they don't care at all. Didn't the Imam say to Yunus ibn Abd al-Rahman that as long as your Imam is pleased with you, you don't need to care about anyone else? Why care about anyone else?

And Allah will never disgrace or humiliate him. Whoever recites this supplication concerning Imam Husayn, peace be upon him – Allah will never disgrace or humiliate him. You see how many benefits there are in just one small supplication, which is not even four lines long.

#### The Supplication for Connection with Imam Husayn

When Ubayy ibn Ka'b, a great companion and narrator of hadith, heard all this, he asked, "O Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, `مَا هَذِهِ الدَّعْوَاتُ` (What are these supplications)? What is this supplication? Please tell me what this supplication is?"

The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, said:

`تَقُولُ إِذَا فَرَغْتَ مِنْ صَلَاتِكَ`
(You say when you finish your prayer).
- [Reference needed]

"When you finish your prayer, just recite these few sentences: `اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْأَلُكَ` (O Allah, I ask You...)" It is a short supplication, consisting of four sentences, and you only need to recite it after prayers. It doesn't even take five seconds, not more than five or ten seconds. If someone memorizes it, it's very easy. This is the supplication related to Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, which the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, taught to Ubayy ibn Ka'b.

### The Foundational Condition: Affection for the Holy Prophet's Kin (Mawaddah fil Qurba)

Whoever connects with Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, receives so many benefits, so many things that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, has mentioned. There is only one condition for this. And what is that condition? Look at the condition which is verse number 23 of Surah Ash-Shura:

`قُلْ لَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَى`
(Say, "I do not ask of you for it any payment except affection for [my] kindred.")
- [42:23]

O Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, say to them: "I do not ask anything from you. I ask for nothing. What do I ask for? Only that there be love for my Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them. That's all."

#### Exegesis of Surah Ash-Shura, Verse 23-24

And what does the following verse say? This is verse number 24:

`وَمَنْ يَقْتَرِفْ حَسَنَةً نَزِدْ لَهُ فِيهَا حُسْنًا`
(And whoever earns a good deed, We will increase for him therein good).
- [42:24]

`یَقْتَرِفْ` means to earn, `iktisab` (acquisition). If anyone earns a good deed, Allah says, "We will increase his good deed. We will further augment his good deed." It is a promise of the Lord:

`إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يُخْلِفُ الْمِيعَادَ`
(Indeed, Allah does not break the promise).
- [3:9]

Allah never breaks a promise. When Allah makes a promise, He fulfills it. Allah's promise is not like our promises, where we might fulfill half and not the other half. Whatever Allah promises, He will give at least that much, at least that much. And then after that, `insha'Allah` (God willing), as stated in the hadith: `یَقْتَرِفْ نَزِدْ لَهُ فِيهَا حُسْنًا` (he earns, We will increase for him therein good). We will further increase his good deeds.

`إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ`
(Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Appreciative).
- [42:23]

Allah is `Ghafur` (Forgiving) and `Shakur` (Appreciative). `Shakur` means the One who appreciates greatly, the Giver of immense reward. There is no limit to Allah's reward. If you study the hadiths on reward, you will find such hadiths that a person cannot even imagine. And people say, "How is this possible? How is that possible?" But all those things are possible because Allah can do it.

#### The Meaning of "Earning a Good Deed" in the Context of Imamate

Now, in the exegesis of this verse, see what the Imam says regarding what this earning of good deeds (`اَلْاِقْتِرَافُ` - al-iqtiraf) is. The Imam says:

`التَّسْلِیمُ لَنَا`
(Submission to us).
- [Reference needed]

A person should be submissive before us, submissive before the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them. Whatever the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them, commands, he should follow. Whatever the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them, says, he should follow. This is `Taslim` (submission) – total submission.

### The Imperative of Submission and Truthfulness to the Imams

And the Imam also said regarding earning good deeds:

`وَالصِّدْقُ عَلَیْنَا`
(And truthfulness towards us).
- [Reference needed]

And he should always attribute truth to us; he should never attribute any falsehood to us. This is important because nowadays, such things are circulating on WhatsApp that have no head or tail. Anyone just posts anything in the name of hadith. Attributing lies to the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them, is a major sin. It even breaks one's fast, just imagine.

#### The Dangers of Fabricating Hadith

We should be aware of the Shia method of hadith narration, which is not like that of the Sunnis. What is the Sunni method of hadith narration? `عَنْ عَنْ` (on the authority of, on the authority of). They say `عَنْ عَنْ عَنْ عَنْ` ("I heard from him, he heard from him, he heard from him, he heard from him"), and because of "hearing" (`sunna`), they were called Sunnis. If you call them Sunnis from this perspective, it's fine. Otherwise, they are not Sunnis according to the `Sunnah` (tradition) of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. They are Sunnis because of `عَنْ عَنْ عَنْ عَنْ`.

#### The Shia Methodology of Hadith Transmission

But we did not have such a method; it is not allowed at all. For example, a person went to Ayatollah Sheikh Bashir al-Najafi and said, "No, you people only follow hadith." So he asked, "Do you have Sheikh Tusi with you? Agha Bashir al-Najafi asked, 'Is Sheikh Tusi yours? Who are you? Are you Sheikh Saduq? Who are you?'" Meaning, his point was that you cannot speak without basis. If you say anything, always give a reference to a book. If anyone is speaking without a book reference, quoting any hadith, it is not obligatory to accept it from him. If you are very familiar with him, you can ask him for the reference, "Brother, you are quoting this hadith." Just two or four days ago, someone posted such a hadith. It's very easy nowadays: just post `اقوال معصومین` (sayings of the infallibles) on WhatsApp. Since he was an acquaintance, who used to come to our class a long time ago, we told him, "Brother, what are you doing? What nonsense are you writing? Are you selling everything?" He said, "It's a hadith." We said, "Brother, there is no such hadith." "Where did you get it from?" He said, "It's `aqwal Ma'sumeen`." We said, "Oh brother, this book is not reliable. It has no basis." This is a very important thing; we are giving a very important message. So, if you ever take anything, always ask people if there is a reference, and the reference should mostly be from an original book, a primary source. Otherwise, at least it should be from a reliable author. Otherwise, many things get published that are not true. This is a major sin. Many people take it lightly; it should not be taken lightly. And if someone does something like this, they should be stopped. If you have relations and the matter won't worsen, you can stop them and ask, "Where are you saying this from? Give its reference." And have it checked if you know someone, "Is this a hadith or not?"

So the Imam says again:

`وَالصِّدْقُ عَلَیْنَا وَأَنْ لَا يَكْذِبَ عَلَيْنَا`
(And truthfulness towards us, and that no one should lie against us).
- [Reference needed]

The Imam is emphasizing again that no one should attribute any falsehood to us. No falsehood should be attributed. How important this is! But people generally say anything and speak or read anything from anywhere. We have personally observed this. And when you question them, they say, "Oh, we heard it from so-and-so." Here, hearsay does not work. We do not have this system.

Do you know what system the Imams, peace be upon them, established? The system of the Imams, peace be upon them, was that when they taught something, they would tell their students to write it down. To write it. And if you don't write it, you don't have the right to narrate it. There are indeed many hadiths among us Shias; every hadith book, like Bihar al-Anwar or Usul al-Kafi, has an entire chapter on the importance of writing. And whoever wrote it down then had the right to transmit it further. They would say, "Look, I have written this, and the Imam signed it. This is what I got from the Imam, and the Imam signed it." So, whatever Shias used to read, they would then transmit it accordingly. And for example, if we read something from someone, we attended their class and read something from them, we cannot transmit that thing further unless we show our hadith books to our teacher. When they showed them to the teacher, the teacher would check it and then sign it, saying, "Yes, now this person can narrate this hadith." We are telling you, we don't have this culture among us, but we should. Until a person is 100% sure, they should not narrate this thing.

#### The Three Commandments: Ma'rifat, Radd, and Taslim

In Usul al-Kafi, Sheikh Kulayni narrates a tradition, in Volume One, Chapter al-Taslim wa Fadl al-Muslimin (Chapter on Submission and the Virtue of the Submissive), hadith number five. Sheikh Kulayni narrates from Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him. This hadith is such that the Imam says:

`أُمِرَ النَّاسُ بِمَعْرِفَتِنَا`
(People have been commanded to gain knowledge of us).
- [Usul al-Kafi, Vol. 1, Ch. al-Taslim wa Fadl al-Muslimin, Hadith 5]

People have been commanded to gain knowledge of us. This is the very first thing. It is obligatory to gain `ma'rifat` (knowledge/recognition) of the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them. It is obligatory. What is that knowledge (`ma'rifat`)? `Ma'rifat` means to be acquainted with their hadiths and their teachings. And to be acquainted means to be aware, to have knowledge of it. The more one has, then one should pray to Allah that Allah grants them this `ma'rifat`. Granting this `ma'rifat` is Allah's work; it is not the work of a servant.

What is next after that?

`وَالرَّدُّ إِلَيْنَا`
(And to refer back to us).
- [Usul al-Kafi, Vol. 1, Ch. al-Taslim wa Fadl al-Muslimin, Hadith 5]

People have been commanded to refer back to us, to refer every matter to us. To refer to us. That is, not to go to anyone else. Meaning, that person lies who imagines that he is our Shia:

`وَهُوَ مُتَمَسِّكٌ بِعُرْوَةِ غَيْرِنَا`
(while he holds fast to the handhold of others).
- [Usul al-Kafi, Vol. 1, Ch. al-Taslim wa Fadl al-Muslimin, Hadith 5]

While he holds onto the hem of someone else. He goes to someone else's door, he takes someone else's hadiths, he takes someone else's teachings – he is lying. `كَذَبَ` (He lied).

`مَنْ زَعَمَ أَنَّهُ مُتَمَسِّكٌ بِعُرْوَتِنَا وَأَنَّهُ مِنْ شِيعَتِنَا وَهُوَ مُتَمَسِّكٌ بِعُرْوَةِ غَيْرِنَا`
(Whoever claims that he holds fast to our handhold and that he is from our Shias, while he holds fast to the handhold of others).
- [Usul al-Kafi, Vol. 1, Ch. al-Taslim wa Fadl al-Muslimin, Hadith 5]

He goes to someone else's door, asks from someone else, and says he is our Shia. Strange. It's strange, the event is strange.

`وَالتَّسْلِيمُ لَنَا`
(And submission to us).
- [Usul al-Kafi, Vol. 1, Ch. al-Taslim wa Fadl al-Muslimin, Hadith 5]

And the third thing is this: to accept whatever we say. `Wal-Taslimu Lana` (And submission to us).

#### The Peril of Polytheism Through Disregard for the Imams' Wilayah

`ثُمَّ قَالَ` (Then he said):

`إِنْ صَامُوا وَصَلُّوا وَشَهِدُوا لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَجَعَلُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ أَن لَّا يَرُدُّو إِلَيْنَا كَانُوا كَذَلِكَ مُشْرِكِينَ`
(If they fast and pray and testify `لا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ` (there is no god but Allah), but harbor in themselves the thought that they will not refer back to us, then they are indeed polytheists).
- [Usul al-Kafi, Vol. 1, Ch. al-Taslim wa Fadl al-Muslimin, Hadith 5]

The Imam says: If they fast, pray, and recite the kalima `لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ` (there is no god but Allah), doing all this, but have this thought in their heart that they will not refer to the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them, in this matter, then by this thought alone, they become polytheists. They are not Muslims.

And this is not surprising. This is a verse from the Qur'an, the last verse of Surah Al-Kahf; you may read it. The verse of Surah Al-Kahf begins:

`قُلْ إِنَّمَا أَنَا بَشَرٌ مِثْلُكُمْ يُوحَىٰ إِلَيَّ أَنَّمَا إِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ`
(Say, "I am only a human being like you, to whom it has been revealed that your God is one God.")
- [18:110]

O Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, say to them: "I am a human being like you, the only difference between you and me is that revelation has come to me that there is no god besides Allah."

`فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ`
(So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord)—whoever wishes to meet his Lord, who hopes for the meeting with the Lord—what should he do?

`فَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا`
(Let him not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord).
- [18:110]

In the exegesis of this verse, the Imam says: meaning, do not associate anyone in the `wilayah` (guardianship) of the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them. `SubhanAllah` (Glory be to Allah).

#### The Exemplary Submission of Kulayb al-Taslim

So this level, this level, meaning the spirit of submission, until this level is achieved, a person cannot truly call himself a Shia of the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them.

In this same chapter, there is another hadith where the narrator said to the Imam that you have a follower whose name is Kulayb. So whenever we narrate a hadith to him from you, saying, "The Imam said," he simply says, "The Imam said," and he accepts it. He doesn't question anything. His level of submission is so high, his spirit of `taslim` (submission) is so elevated, that we named him Kulayb al-Taslim. The Imam says, regarding the sentence of the hadith:

`فَتَرَحَّمَ عَلَيْهِ`
(Then he prayed for mercy upon him).
- [Usul al-Kafi, Vol. 1, Ch. al-Taslim wa Fadl al-Muslimin, Hadith (number needed)]

The Imam said, `رَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ رَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ` (May Allah's mercy be upon him, may Allah's mercy be upon him).

### Debunking the Lie: Who "Killed" Imam Husayn?

And this was that spirit, the spirit of submission, that gathered the 72 with Husayn in Karbala. Look, what do people generally say about Shias? "Who killed Imam Husayn?" "Shias killed him." "Who killed him?" "The Shias who were in Kufa, when they were in Kufa, the Shias killed him and the Shias murdered him"—all this is nonsense, all this is Umayyad propaganda.

#### The Reality of the Numbers in Kufa

First of all, not all in Kufa were Shias. The number of actual Shias in Kufa was very small. Their number was a maximum of 10% or, at most, 15%. This is one point.

#### The Abandonment by Companions and Others

The second point was that if they say Shias killed him, then we say, "Okay, fine, Shias killed him, didn't they? Yes, okay, your point is valid. We accept it then. Right?" Now, tell us, where did Sayyid al-Shuhada set out from? From Medina. And Sayyid al-Shuhada told everyone, "Where am I going?" Everyone knew where he was going. After that, he came to Mecca. Everyone knew in Mecca. People came to meet Imam Husayn, peace be upon him. Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, was not a stranger whom people didn't recognize. It is duly written in all Shia and Sunni books about Imam Husayn's journey: what happened in Medina after that invitation, meaning, after the invitation to pledge allegiance. When they were told to pledge allegiance. So what happened in Medina? It's all written in detail. After that, what happened in Mecca? After that, Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, came to Karbala. It was a very long journey to Karbala. Just think, from the 8th of Dhul Hijjah until the 2nd of Muharram. That is 24 days. It is 24 days. For 24 days, everyone knew where Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, was going. And in Karbala, from the 2nd of Muharram until Ashura, add another eight days. Eight days, seven days. So, such a long journey of 31 days. And if you count from the 28th of Rajab, then after Rajab comes Sha'ban. After Sha'ban comes Ramadan. After Ramadan comes Shawwal. After that comes Dhul Qa'dah. After that, Dhul Hijjah. For so many months, everyone knew who Husayn ibn Ali was. Why did Husayn ibn Ali leave Medina? Why did he come to Mecca? Why did he go from Mecca to Iraq? Everyone knew.

But finally, answer one question for us. Answer one question: How many Muhajireen and how many Ansar were there to help Husayn ibn Ali? How many Companions were there who came to help Imam Husayn, peace be upon him? Please tell us first. How many came? Who all were there? Either they stayed in Medina, or they stayed in Mecca, or they remained silent. Because remaining silent is also a sin.

#### The Concept of Khudhlan (Abandonment)

Silence means `khudhlan` (abandonment), meaning not helping. What the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, said in Ghadir:

`ٱللَّٰهُمَّ وَالِ مَنْ وَالَاهُ وَعَادِ مَنْ عَادَاهُ وَٱنْصُرْ مَنْ نَصَرَهُ وَٱخْذُلْ مَنْ خَذَلَهُ`
(O Allah, befriend him who befriends him [Ali], and be hostile to him who is hostile to him, and help him who helps him, and forsake him who forsakes him).
- [Hadith Ghadir]

Whoever abandons Commander of the Faithful. `Khudhlan` means not coming for help, abandoning him. Now, whoever Allah abandons, can he be saved? Similarly, whoever abandons Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, can he be saved?

That is why when Sayyid al-Shuhada set out from Medina, he said to Bani Hashim: "I am going. And whoever comes with me will be killed. Whoever comes with me will be killed. And whoever does not come with me will never achieve success." Now there are only two things. That's it. Either go along and be killed, or abandon him but you will never achieve success.

So, anyway, many people did leave Medina, you know. And they came up to Mecca. Then in Mecca, when they saw that Yazid had sent some terrorists there to assassinate Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, inside the Ka'bah, many people said, "Brother, it seems this matter will become very messy." So they left Imam Husayn, peace be upon him. Then, after Husayn left Mecca, people kept abandoning him at every stage. The numbers kept decreasing. Why? Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, was saying at every stage, "Look, the outcome is the same, right? Understand. Because I am not going to pledge allegiance. The outcome is the same." So those who were truly firm in their promise, truly strong in faith, only they stayed. And how many were they? Like salt in a lentil dish. Yes.

But what was their status? Their status was that the Princess of the Two Worlds greets them. Lady Zaynab, peace be upon them, greets them. Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him, further says:

`ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا أَنْصَارَ دِينِ ٱللَّٰهِ`
(Peace be upon you, O helpers of Allah's religion!)
- [Reference needed]

`ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يَا أَنْصَارَ رَسُولِ ٱللَّٰهِ`
(Peace be upon you, O helpers of the Messenger of Allah!)
- [Reference needed]

This is the impact of Karbala. Do not take Karbala lightly, do not misunderstand Karbala. Karbala is not just a name for customs and traditions. Karbala, Karbala is such a thing, it is an `iksir` (elixir), an elixir. `Iksir` means elixir of life. Meaning, Karbala is `Aab-e-Hayat` (the water of life). It is the water of life.

That is why someone recited a poem. What is the poem? Listen. Meaning, it's not just a poem, what should we call it? It's strange. This was truly inspired by `Ruh al-Qudus` (the Holy Spirit), the poet who composed this verse:
"The people of Karbala found their destination in two afternoons—two afternoons meaning two parts of a day. The people of Karbala found their destination in two afternoons, while Khidr wandered with eternal life."
The people of Karbala, in two afternoons, meaning from morning till afternoon, found life. And Khidr wandered with eternal life. Khidr drank the water of life. Khidr asked for the water of life, and Allah gave him the water of life. He received the water of life. To this day, Prophet Khidr, peace be upon him, is alive. But what did the poet say? This is the impact of Karbala. And that is why it is obligatory, not merely recommended, but obligatory, to keep Karbala alive. And this is the help for Husayn. This is the help for the Holy Prophet's family, peace be upon them.

### Anas ibn Harithah: A Testament to Help and Waiting

Look, we have heard an incident from scholars. We have not read it in a book, we searched, we did not find it; perhaps someone else might find it and can inform us. Heard from scholars, great scholars. I have not read it myself, but it might exist somewhere, yes, it might be in some `maqtal` (account of martyrdom). We don't deny it; we are just relaying what we have heard.

There was a man named Anas ibn Harithah, who was a slave of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family; he was a servant of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family; he served the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. His name was Anas ibn Harithah. During the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, he heard from him that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, said: "My grandson Husayn will be martyred in Karbala. Husayn will be killed in Karbala, and whoever comes to his aid, whoever helps him, I guarantee his salvation. I guarantee that he will be saved."

So Anas ibn Harithah says that the martyrdom of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, occurred before him. After that, the era of Commander of the Faithful came. I stayed with Commander of the Faithful; I kept serving him. Until Commander of the Faithful was also martyred. Then after Commander of the Faithful, with Imam Hasan al-Mujtaba, peace be upon him. After that, Imam Hasan al-Mujtaba, peace be upon him, was martyred. Then I became so old that I was no longer fit to serve Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, or to be his servant.

Therefore, this incident begins like this: a man is passing by from somewhere (meaning, when is this incident? This incident is 10 years before the martyrdom of Imam Husayn, peace be upon him). He was passing by and saw that Karbala was a desert at that time. A tent was pitched there. A tent in the middle of a desert made no sense. So he looked into the tent and asked who was there. An old man said, "Who are you?"

`قَالَ أَنَسُ ٱبْنُ حَارِثَةَ`
(He said, Anas ibn Harithah).
- [Reference needed]

He asked, "What's the meaning of a tent being pitched here?" So he narrated the whole incident that I just told you. That I heard from the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. So when I heard, I was no longer fit to serve Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, and I didn't know if I would live or not, so I came to Karbala and pitched my tent here so that whenever Husayn comes, at least I will be here to help Husayn. This reveals two things: first, the importance of helping the Imam, and second, the importance of waiting. Anas ibn Harithah waited for 10 years, and when Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, reached Karbala, Anas ibn Harithah met him, and then Anas ibn Harithah and his companions were martyred. So this spirit, this submission.

### The Sacrifice of Ali al-Akbar (AS): A Detailed Narration

And one after another, all were martyred, until the moment came when Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, said to his son Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them:

`تَقَدَّمْ يَا بُنَيَّ`
(Go forth, O my son!).
- [Maqtal al-Husayn, (Author & Page needed)]

"O my son, go to be martyred." Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, was ready. Husayn said, "Son, go get permission from the tent." Ali al-Akbar went to the tent and first told his mother that he had to be martyred. She said, "Go get permission from your aunt, who raised you with such tenderness and care." He came before his aunt. His aunt granted permission. Lady Zaynab, peace be upon them, said, "Son, I raised you for 18 years for this very purpose, so that you would come forth in this field. Aunt, if you don't give permission now, it's okay. But what if tomorrow, on the Day of Judgment, Grandmother asks, 'Who was more beloved? My Husayn or Ali al-Akbar?'" As soon as Lady Zaynab, peace be upon them, heard this much, she said, "Be silent, my son, I give you permission."

Habib ibn Muslim says that when Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, wanted to leave the tent, some lady grabbed his hem and began pulling him. It is not known who that lady was. But it was a beloved one who would hold the hem; if it had been a senior lady, she would have held his arm. Habib ibn Muslim says that Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, left the tent like the corpse of a young man.

Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, came and stood before Imam Husayn. Husayn himself prepared Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, and prepared him, saying:

`ٱللَّٰهُمَّ ٱشْهَدْ عَلَىٰ ٱلْقَوْمِ`
(O Allah, bear witness against this people!),
- [Maqtal al-Husayn, (Author & Page needed)]

"O Lord, bear witness against this people!":

`قَدْ بَرَزَ إِلَيْهِمْ غُلَامٌ`
(A young man has emerged against them)
- [Maqtal al-Husayn, (Author & Page needed)]

`أَشْبَهُ ٱلنَّاسِ خَلْقًا وَخُلُقًا وَمَنْطِقًا إِلَىٰ رَسُولِكَ`
(who is the most similar of people in creation, character, and speech to Your Messenger).
- [Maqtal al-Husayn, (Author & Page needed)]

He was the most similar to Your Prophet; whenever we longed to see Your Prophet, we would look at Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them. After that, Husayn bade farewell to Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them.

Now, quickly listen to the phrases from the `maqtal`. Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, started moving. As soon as Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, was riding on his horse, he felt a presence. So what did he see when he turned around? He saw Husayn approaching, holding his back, saying, `یَا عَلِيٌّ یَا عَلِيٌّ یَا عَلِيٌّ` (O Ali! O Ali! O Ali!). "Father, you have bid farewell, my son. If you had children, you would know what it means to bid farewell to a young son." Husayn bade farewell. Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, went. It is written in the `maqtal` that Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, sent many villains to hell. Until now, whoever went to the battlefield had not returned alive, except Wahb al-Kalbi. And the other was Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them.

But how did he come? It was a mother's heart. It was Umm Layla's heart. It was the matter of a young son. She said, "Fizza, please stand at the door of the tent for a moment. Watch, it's the matter of a young son. If the Master's face changes color, understand that my son is in great difficulty. He is in great trouble." So Fizza came. After a while, she said, "Lady, the Master's face has changed color." She said, "Please trouble the Master a bit." Husayn came. When Husayn came, Umm Layla asked, "Master, why has your face changed color?" He said, "My son is hungry and thirsty for three days, and a renowned wrestler has come before him, who is fully satisfied and quenched." One just had to hear this. Umm Layla's heart trembled. She said, "Master, what should I do?" He said, "Pray. A mother's prayer is accepted for her son." Umm Layla said, "Ladies, form a circle." A circle was formed. Umm Layla raised her hands in prayer.

`اِلٰہِيْ! بِغُرْبَةِ الْحُسَيْنِ۔ بِغُرْبَةِ الْأَيْتَامِ۔`
(My God! By the loneliness of Husayn. By the loneliness of the orphans.)
- [Reference needed]

"By the helplessness of Husayn, I ask You. O You who reunited Jacob with Joseph, reunite my Ali al-Akbar with his father." Her prayer was not yet complete when Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, arrived. But in what state did he arrive? He was covered in wounds, bathed in blood, and what did he say when he came?

`يَا أَبَتِ الْعَطَشُ قَدْ قَتَلَنِي`
(O father, thirst has killed me!).
- [Maqtal al-Husayn, (Author & Page needed)]

"Father, thirst is killing me!"

`وَٱلسَّيْفُ وَٱلْحَدِيدُ قَدْ أَجْهَدَنِي`
(And the sword and iron have exhausted me!).
- [Maqtal al-Husayn, (Author & Page needed)]

"Now I cannot bear the weight of the sword anymore."

`هَلْ إِلَىٰ شَرْبَةِ مَاءٍ سَبِيلٌ؟`
(Is there any way to a sip of water?)
- [Maqtal al-Husayn, (Author & Page needed)]

"Father, a little water." Husayn said, "Son, you know that there isn't a drop of water in the tent. `هَاتِ لِسَانَكَ` (Give me your tongue)." Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, placed his tongue in Husayn's blessed mouth. It's a strange phrase from the `maqtal`: "Pull it back immediately." "Father, your tongue has thorns on it." Husayn gave him his ring. He said, "Go now, your grandfather will quench your thirst from the water of Kawthar."

Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, went. And he kept fighting, kept fighting. Just once, a wretch, a wicked one, took aim at Ali al-Akbar's, peace be upon them, chest. And he struck him with such a spear. The spear went deep into Ali al-Akbar's, peace be upon them, chest. Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, fell from his horse. As soon as he fell, listen to the phrase from the `maqtal`; I will just tell you two or three phrases from the `maqtal` and the gathering will conclude. It is written that Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, went among the wicked. When the horse took him amidst the wicked:

`فَقَتَلُوهُ بِسُيُوفِهِمْ وَقَطَّعُوهُ بِسُيُوفِهِمْ وَبِالْحِرَبَا`
(So they killed him with their swords and cut him into pieces with their swords and spears).
- [Maqtal al-Husayn, (Author & Page needed)]

What did those people do to Ali al-Akbar's, peace be upon them, body? Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, cried out, "Father! Help for Ali al-Akbar!" Husayn, like a lion, pounced upon the wicked. The wicked scattered. He reached Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them. He placed Ali al-Akbar's, peace be upon them, head on his lap. Father and son conversed for a short while. Husayn pulled out the tip of the spear. When it was pulled from Ali al-Akbar's, peace be upon them, chest, a fountain of blood gushed forth. Ali al-Akbar, peace be upon them, departed from this world.

Husayn then recited:

`يَا بُنَيَّ، يَا بُنَيَّ، عَلَى ٱلدُّنْيَا بَعْدَكَ ٱلْعَفَا`
(O my son, O my son, after you, farewell to this world!).
- [Maqtal al-Husayn, (Author & Page needed)]

"O my son, after you, let there be dust upon the life of this world!" In this manner,

`طَابَ مِنْ هَمِّ ٱلدُّنْيَا وَغَمِّهَا`
(He became relieved from the worries and grief of the world).
- [Maqtal al-Husayn, (Author & Page needed)]

"Son, you are free from the worries and grief of this world."

`وَبَقِيَ أَبُوكَ وَحِيدًا قَلِيلًا بَيْنَ ٱلْأَعْدَاءِ`
(And your father remains alone, a few among the enemies).
- [Maqtal al-Husayn, (Author & Page needed)]

"Your father is surrounded by enemies, all alone."

`وَا عَلِيَّا!` (O Ali!), `وَا حُسَيْنَا!` (O Husayn!), `وَا مَظْلُومَا!` (O Oppressed One!).
