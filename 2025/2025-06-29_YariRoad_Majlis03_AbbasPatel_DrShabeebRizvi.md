### 1. Introduction: The Core Hadith of Imam Husayn (AS)

Our master and leader, Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them both, said:

ولو صبرتم على الأذى وتحملتم المؤونة في ذات الله كانت أمور الله عليكم ترد وعنكم تصدر وإليكم ترجع
(And if you had been patient in the face of harm and borne the burden for the sake of Allah, the affairs of Allah would have come to you, originated from you, and returned to you.)
- [Reference needed]

Our master and leader, Husayn ibn Ali, peace be upon them both, spoke the truth.

The noble hadith chosen for this discourse begins with the Imam's statement: ولو صبرتم على الأذى (And if you had been patient in the face of harm). This means if you had endured suffering and tolerated hardships in the path of Allah, then the affairs of Allah would descend upon you, originate from you, and revert to you. The details of this concept were presented in two previous sittings. However, what was done instead? Matters were handed over to the oppressors. Consequently, the oppressors began to act according to their own will, and all affairs fell into their hands. The Imam then proceeds to explain what these oppressors do.

### 2. The Actions of Oppressors: Acting with Doubts and Desires

It is crucial to pay close attention to every word and reflect upon it. The Imam thoroughly explains the actions of oppressors once matters fall into their hands.

#### 2.1. Acting with Doubts (Shubuhat)

The first thing the Imam states is that the oppressors یعملون بالشبهات (they act with doubts/ambiguities). This implies that these individuals have acted with `shubuhat` (doubts/ambiguities).

##### 2.1.1. The Nature of `Shubh` (Doubt)

In Arabic, `shubh` (doubt) refers to something that is doubtful. The Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali (AS), in a hadith, thoroughly elaborated and explained what `shubh` means and how `shubh` is created. He states:

انما سمیت الشبهة شبهة لأنها تشبه الحق
(A doubt is called a doubt only because it resembles the truth.)
- [Reference needed]

A doubt is called a `shubh` because the word `shubh` in Arabic is derived from `mushabahat` (similarity). This means that a `shubh` looks very, very similar to the truth. Doubt arises when a person cannot distinguish between truth and falsehood; they become confused and cannot discern what is truth and what is falsehood. The Imam says `shubh` is called `shubh` precisely because لأنها تشبه الحق (because it resembles the truth). This falsehood, this doubt, looks so similar to the truth that a person cannot understand that it is not the truth.

##### 2.1.2. The Distinction Between `Awliya Allah` and `A'da Allah`

As for أولياء الله (the friends of Allah), they are characterized as:

فزیائهم فيها اليقين
(Their appearance in it is certainty.)
- [Reference needed]

They derive light from certainty. They are at such a stage of certainty that they understand what is truth and what is falsehood. As was presented in a previous gathering, it is always very important to ask the right questions. This is why it is also mentioned in narrations that:

حسن السؤال نصف الجواب
(A good question is half the answer.)
- [Reference needed]

When a person contemplates a problem, they ask good questions. The Imam here states that the `awliya` (friends) of Allah benefit from the light of certainty; they use this light and gain advantage from it.

Furthermore, for the friends of Allah:

ودليلهم سمت الهدیٰ
(And their guide is the path of guidance.)
- [Reference needed]

This is a very profound statement. Their guide, meaning that which guides them, is the path of guidance itself. This is why, in a very famous narration, Abu Basir came to the Imam and expressed his sadness at seeing the poor character of some Shias, while their opponents exhibited good character and devotion in worship. He mentioned how quick-tempered Shias were compared to the calm demeanor of their opponents. Abu Basir, the narrator, stated that opponents use the word سمت الہدیٰ (the direction of guidance) to describe their direction. The Imam immediately interrupted, saying, "Don't say `samth` (direction). Say `seema` (sign)." When Abu Basir asked for the difference, the Imam explained that `samth` means path. So, by saying `samth al-huda`, one would imply they are on the path of guidance, which they are not. Instead, he said, one should say سیماء الہدیٰ (the sign of guidance), meaning they only walk around wearing the guise of guidance; their appearance is merely a guise, not the actual path.

In the hadith from Sayyid al-Shuhada (Imam Husayn), peace be upon him, it states: دلیلہ سمت الہدیٰ (His guidance is the path of guidance). What indicates the أولياء الله (friends of Allah)? The path of guidance itself. They are truly on the path of guidance and do not abandon it. They seek `tawassul` (intercession) completely from the Ahlul Bayt and do not deviate from this `tawassul` for a single moment. In everything, they carry the Quran and Hadith with them, never abandoning their path. So, the Master states دلیلہ سمت الہدیٰ (His guidance is the path of guidance).

However, as for others:

وأما أعداء الله
(And as for the enemies of Allah.)
- [Reference needed]

Now, notice who the Imam used in opposition to أولياء الله (the friends of Allah)? أعداء الله (the enemies of Allah). These are those who abandoned the Ahlul Bayt, thus abandoning the path of Allah.

What are they like now?

فدعا ودعاؤهم فيها الضلال
(So their call and their prayers are for misguidance.)
- [Reference needed]

Any path they call to will be the path of misguidance, not guidance. Whatever they do will be nothing but misguidance, because the Quran says:

فماذا بعد الحق إلا الضلال
(What else is there after truth except error/misguidance?)
- Quran, Surah Yunus (10), Verse 32

Since they abandoned the truth and the path of guidance, whatever they call to now will be nothing but misguidance.

And their guide:

ودليلهم العمى
(And their guide is blindness.)
- [Reference needed]

Their guidance is blindness, it is misguidance. They are simply wandering, unaware of their direction. Just as the Quran says about the Children of Israel:

يتيهون في الأرض أربعين سنة
(They wandered in the land for forty years.)
- Quran, Surah Al-Ma'idah (5), Verse 26

For 40 years, not just a day or two, the Children of Israel wandered in circles. Why did Allah leave them to their own devices? Because they abandoned the representative of Allah (`Hujjat Allah`). Consequently, for 40 years, they were kept in that wandering state. `Yatieh` is derived from `tieh`, meaning `taha yatiehu`, and `tieh` means wandering. They kept wandering for 40 years. Forty years is a very long period. Wandering means if a person gets lost for an hour or two, they become distressed. Allah made the Children of Israel wander for 40 years because they abandoned the representative of Allah.

So here, the Master states: دعاؤهم فيها الضلال ودليلهم العمى (their call is for misguidance, and their guide is blindness).

The Imam then transitions to discuss the reality of life and death:

فما ينجو من الموت من خافه
(So he who fears death will not escape it.)
- [Reference needed]

Whoever fears death will not escape it. If you think that by fearing death, you will escape it, that is impossible. Everyone has to die. Everyone has to go. Whether death comes tomorrow or today, and nowadays, we are witnessing many sudden deaths. News of young people dying comes daily; this has increased compared to before. So the Master states that the fear of death cannot save a person from death. Everyone has to die, everyone has to leave. And the true death, meaning the death of felicity, is to be in the presence of Allah's representative, in their court. Just as Saeed died, Saeed breathed his last in the lap of Imam Husayn, by his side. He asked the Imam:

حل وفیت يا ابن رسول اللہ؟
(Have I fulfilled my loyalty, O son of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family)?
- [Reference needed]

Have I fulfilled the right of loyalty, O son of the Messenger of Allah?

This guidance came from Sayyid al-Shuhada (Imam Husayn) himself. When Sayyid al-Shuhada left Mecca to come to Karbala, as he advanced towards Iraq, his brother Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah asked him, "Why are you doing this? What is the reason?" The hadith is very long, but one sentence that Sayyid al-Shuhada stated was very striking. He said that these people will not leave him until they take his life. The words the Master used are very profound. He said:

علقة من قلبي
(a blood clot from my heart).
- [Reference needed]

What is `alaqa` called? The embryo, the fetus, the embryo, that is called `alaqa` in Arabic at the stage when it is full of blood, an entire clot of blood. The Master states that until they drink all the blood of my heart, they will not find peace. They will not leave me until then.

So he states: فما ينجو من الموت من خافه (So he who fears death will not escape it), and:

ولا يعطى البقاء من أحبه
(Nor will he who loves life be granted permanence.)
- [Reference needed]

And if someone loves life, they will not remain forever. If a person thinks, "I want to live, I love this world," they will not remain forever.

#### 2.2. Moving in Desires (Shahawat)

So the Master states: What did they do? یعملون بالشبهات (They act with doubts/ambiguities). This is the first characteristic of these oppressors. And the second is:

ويسيرون فی الشهوات
(They move in desires.)
- [Reference needed]

Their path was entirely one of desires, meaning fulfilling their own desires. They only want to fulfill their desires, nothing else. "We want this, we want that," they are driven solely by desires.

Now, see what the Master states about desires:

ولم يملك نفسه عن الشهوات
(And he did not control his soul from desires.)
- [Reference needed]

These are individuals who have no control over their desires. They do not control their desires. Whatever lust arises within them, they want to obtain that lust. They are mad for lust. In Urdu, the best word for `shahwat` (desire) is `hawas` (lust). It is the human carnal lust, the carnal desire, which constantly commands them to attain this, attain that, this world, that world.

##### 2.2.1. Lack of Self-Control and Self-Condemnation

The Master states: لم يملك نفسه عن الشهوات (He did not control his soul from desires). And further:

ومن لم يعزل نفسه في الشهوات
(And he who does not condemn his soul regarding desires.)
- [Reference needed]

And he does not condemn his own soul when he falls prey to desires. This is a very significant statement. Firstly, he cannot control his desires. A human makes mistakes; a human falls prey to desires. But the sign of a believer is that when a mistake is committed by them, they condemn their own soul. They condemn themselves greatly. This is what is called `Nafs-e-Lawwama` (the self-reproaching soul). `Lawwama` means reproaching greatly, asking, "Why did I do this?" And in that weeping and lamenting, they sit and recite Dua Kumayl, and other supplications in which they condemn their own soul, saying, "O Lord, forgive me." They weep and lament profusely before Allah.

##### 2.2.2. Satan's Role in Beautifying Deeds

The Master states: But these oppressors, first, they cannot control their desires. Second, they do not condemn their desires. These are both aspects of their wrongdoing. This is what is stated in the words of the Quran. The Quran says:

وزين له الشيطان أعمالهم
(And Satan made their deeds fair-seeming to them.)
- Quran, Surah Al-An'am (6), Verse 43 (also Surah An-Naml 24, Fatir 8, Muhammad 14)

Or in another verse, what is it? وسولت. Wasawwilat. Meaning, his soul made `tasweelah` (beautified) it for him. `Tasweelah` means painting a picture, which means to justify it. To justify it by saying, "Look, it's fine. If you didn't do this, someone else would have. If you didn't commit this forbidden act, someone else would have. If it wasn't this, it would be something else." And in this situation, it was very necessary to do this; it was very necessary. "If we didn't do this, then this would have happened." "We did this for this reason." "Oh, a mistake happened," but then he will justify it. He will say, "No, no, if we didn't do this, then this would have happened, that would have happened. Today, this turned out very well." In this way, he will justify his forbidden acts. For the forbidden acts one commits, the Quran says: زين لهم الشيطان أعمالهم (Satan made their deeds fair-seeming to them).

The Quran mentions 14 actions of Satan. In the Quran, 14 actions of Satan are described, what Satan does. As probably mentioned in another gathering, Dr. Ali Zain-ul-Abidin Baradash wrote a book on Satan. And that book is in two volumes. The entire book is only about Satan. It is approximately 250 pages long. They have only collected hadiths on Satan. This might be a mistake; 250 pages might just be the index, a table of contents. As far as memory is a bit hazy. Anyway, it's entirely on Satan. The whole book is on Satan. It's in two volumes. Yes, 250 pages is just the index. Meaning, of course, the book is in two volumes, a very thick book, a 700-page book. Out of which 250 pages, 243 pages to be precise, is the table of contents. It's a 700-page book, combining two volumes. Or, it was told to halve it, so 350 pages because they brought Arabic on one side and Persian on the other, Persian translation. Therefore, it's entirely on Satan. So, they have enumerated 14 actions of Satan; there are 14 actions of Satan mentioned in the Quran. We are not talking about hadith; in hadith, there are even more details, very detailed. Among them, one action they say Satan does is `tazweer`. `Tazweer` or `tazyeen` (beautification) both have the same meaning. Meaning, Satan presents it adorned; he completely beautifies it, saying, "Look, what you did was a very good thing." That's why you can see, what is one characteristic of the `awliya-e-Shaytan` (friends of Satan), what is one characteristic of those who are friends of Satan? That they never consider their bad deeds to be bad; instead, they justify them and commit them.

##### 2.2.3. The Consequence of Persisting in Sin

The Imam states: When he does this, ولم يملك نفسه عن الشهوات (and he did not control his soul from desires) and ومن لم يعذل نفسه في الشهوات (and he who does not condemn his soul regarding desires). When he does these two things – first, he doesn't condemn his soul, and second, he doesn't control his soul's desires – what happens then?

خاض في الخبائث
(He delves into impurities/evil deeds.)
- [Reference needed]

Now he completely falls into impurities, meaning impure actions and evil deeds. Now, nothing but impurity can be expected from him. That is why it has been said that if a believer ever commits a sin, he should immediately seek repentance and forgiveness. If he does not seek repentance and forgiveness and insists on sins, continues them, then what happens? He leaves the Wilayah (guardianship/allegiance) of the Ahlul Bayt and goes into the Wilayah of Satan. Because for someone who persists in their sins, who insists and continues, it is very difficult for them to remain in the Wilayah of the Ahlul Bayt. It is very difficult, next to impossible. This is present in narration; these are not our words, these are the words of the Imam. He leaves the Wilayah of the Ahlul Bayt and becomes a friend of Satan. He accepts the Wilayah of Satan, and Satan becomes his guardian. And that is why the Quran says about such a person, in Surah An-Nahl, verse 99, that Allah Almighty says:

إنما سلطانه على الذين يتولونه
(His authority is only over those who take him as a guardian.)
- Quran, Surah An-Nahl (16), Verse 99

Satan's authority only extends over those who accept the Wilayah of Satan. His authority runs over them. `Innama sultanuhu` is a verse from Surah An-Nahl: إنما سلطانه على الذين يتولونه (His authority is only over those who take him as a guardian). Those who accept his Wilayah. When they accept his Wilayah, will he not mislead them? On the Day of Judgment, when those people will say to him, "You misled us," he will say, "No, no, don't blame me. I was just inviting you. You responded to my invitation. I was just saying 'come,' and you came." So, he will say:

فلاتلوموني ولوموا أنفسكم
(So do not blame me, but blame yourselves.)
- Quran, Surah Ibrahim (14), Verse 22

So then, "don't blame me, blame yourself. I was just saying, 'Come, come over here.'" He said, "Yes, yes." He said, أهلاً و سہلاً (Welcome), and we said, لبیک یا ابلیس (Here I am, O Iblis). He said `Hadharan`, أهلاً و سہلاً (Be ready, Welcome).

The Master's face, if there's a slight opportunity, it shouldn't be kept bad. He's calling, and how can we not speak? This is a practical thing, isn't it? Many times, we see in life that people, for that very reason, do not dare to say no to those they shouldn't say no to. "How can we say no? What will so-and-so think? What will happen to so-and-so? What will happen to this?" Nothing will happen. Nothing is going to happen. Just say "no, no," and the matter is closed.

### 3. The Fate of the Weak Shias

There is no problem. After that, the Master, Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, states a sentence. The discussion began with the Imam stating that you should be patient with this trust, this Wilayah. You should not let this Wilayah slip from your hands. But what did you do? You handed it over to the oppressors. And what did the oppressors act with? They acted with their desires. They acted with their lusts. Now see what came next, and see what the sentence is:

فَأَسْلَمْتُمُ الضُّعَفَاءَ فِي أَيْدِيهِمْ
(So you handed over the weak into their hands.)
- [Reference needed]

You handed over the weak Shias to these oppressors. Now these weak Shias went into the hands of these oppressors. اسلمتم (You handed over). You handed over. الضُّعَفَاءَ (the weak ones), those who were weak Shias, فِي أَيْدِيهِمْ (into their hands), you handed them over to them.

#### 3.1. Enslavement and Subjugation (`Musta'bad Maqhoor`)

The first category of weak Shias is described:

فَمِنْ بَیْنِ مُسْتَعْبَدٍ مَقْهُورٍ
(So from among them, some were enslaved and subdued.)
- [Reference needed]

Now, these poor weak Shias, some of them became their servants; they were subjugated. They became their `abd` (slaves). `Musta'bad` means they became their `abd`. `Maqhoor` (subdued), these oppressors became powerful; they dominated them, or the poor ones quietly became dominated. They became `maqhoor` before them. Whatever was said, "Yes sir," whatever was said, "Yes sir." Absolutely a servant, absolutely a slave.

#### 3.2. Oppression in Livelihood (`Mustad'af Maghloob`)

And the second type, what happened to them?

وَبَیْنِ مُسْتَضْعَفٍ عَلَى مَعِيشَتِهِ مَغْلُوبٍ
(And from among them, some were oppressed in their livelihood, overpowered.)
- [Reference needed]

They became `mustad'af` (oppressed), they became `dha'eef` (weak). عَلَى مَعِيشَتِهِ (in his livelihood), they were weak even in terms of their livelihood, in terms of money. And they became `maghloob` (overpowered). This one completely overpowered them. And this poor one became overpowered.

Generally, what happens is that wherever Shias face such a situation, the result is that when educated Shias, when they do not step up to defend the weak Shias, those who are weak in their belief and far from their Imam, what happens then? Nasibis (those who bear enmity towards Ahlul Bayt) gain dominance over them. When Nasibis gain dominance over them, naturally, such a weak Shia doesn't even know if this religion is correct, or wrong, or what it is. He knows nothing about religious matters. Now, it's completely under Nasibi control. Nowadays, it's either under Nasibi control or Batri control. Batris somehow bring them under their influence and control them, so they either go under Nasibi control or Batri control.

### 4. The Crucial Role of Shia Scholars (`Ulama`)

Now, the `ulama` (scholars) who are familiar with hadiths. They have a very great responsibility, a very great responsibility. So, the first thing is for those who are not weak, who are not `dhu'afa`, whom Allah has given talent, whom Allah has given intellect, whom Allah has given capability, ability. So it is obligatory for them to make themselves so capable that they become well-versed in the Quran and Hadith. Well-versed. Meaning, they become experts in the Quran and Hadith, and after that, they extract these weak ones from the clutches of the Nasibis. This is a very great responsibility. It's not easy, but it's not impossible either. And if there is the support of the Ahlul Bayt, if they firmly hold on to the Ahlul Bayt, then it is not difficult either. What is the only condition? That one should firmly hold on to the Ahlul Bayt.

Let's just read one hadith and conclude the discussion here. Look at what the hadith says. It's a very famous hadith. Imam Sadiq, peace be upon him, states:

عُلَمَاءُ شِیعَتِنَا
(The scholars of our Shias)
- [Reference needed]

Our Shia scholars, Shia scholars. Who are these `ulama`, meaning who is called an `alim` (scholar), who is called a `faqih` (jurist)? One who is well-versed in hadiths.

#### 4.1. Definition of a `Faqih` (Jurist)

What is the definition of a `faqih` in hadith?

لَا يُعَدُّ رَجُلٌ فَقِيهًا حَتَّى يَعْلَمَ مَعَارِضَ کَلَامِنَا
(A man is not considered a `faqih` until he knows the intricacies of our words.)
- [Reference needed]

This is the definition. That no person will be called a `faqih`, will be called an `alim` until he understands our symbols and hints. He should be familiar with the hints in narrations, and when does one become familiar with hints? When one is completely immersed in hadiths. Only then does he understand that in this hadith, the Imam stated this, and in that hadith, the Imam stated that. As mentioned yesterday, one should choose their pen name thoughtfully. When one does not choose their pen name thoughtfully, then they just pick any pen name. It turns out that, well, it was some other name, anyway.

#### 4.2. Scholars as Guardians at the Frontier (`Murabitun bil-Thagr`)

So, the scholars of our Shias:

عُلَمَاءُ شِیعَتِنَا، مُرَابِطُونَ بِالثَّغْرِ
(The scholars of our Shias are stationed at the frontier.)
- [Reference needed]

`Murabitun bil-thaghr` means, what is a `murabit`? رِبَاطَ الْخَيْلِ، رِبَاطَ الْخَيْلِ (tying of horses), these are Quranic words. Those soldiers on the border who have horses – `khayl` refers to horses – who are standing on the border, `ribat` (stationed), ready for battle, they are called `murabitun`, those who stay at the border. To defend. بالثغر (at the frontier), `thaghr` means border. `Thagr` means border. Those soldiers standing on the border. Whose border is it, for what purpose?

الَّذِي يَلِي إِبْلِيسَ وَأَفَارِيتَهُ
(Which faces Iblis and his `afarit`.)
- [Reference needed]

On this side of the border are Iblis and his `afarit`. `Afarit` is the plural of `ifrit`. `Ifrit` is what we call? A `dev` (giant/demon). They all come from Deoband, don't they? So `afarit` is the plural of `ifrit`. It is the plural of `ifrit`. Meaning, in English, they are called demons. `Ifrit` means Iblis and his `afarit`, they are on this side.

Now what do these scholars do?

يَمْنَعُونَهُمْ عَنِ الْخُرُوجِ عَلَى ضُعَفَاءِ شِيَعَتِنَا
(They prevent them from coming forth against our weak Shias.)
- [Reference needed]

They do not let them cross the border so that they do not attack the weak Shias. So that they do not attack their beliefs. They do not allow it. They are not afraid, they do not panic. They do not fear Iblis and his `afarit`, these Nasibis. Allah has put fear in the hearts of the Nasibis. There is also a verse in the Quran. In the Quran, Allah says that Allah has put awe of you in their hearts. They fear you, so you should not fear them. The Quran says:

اَلَّذِينَ يُبَلِّغُونَ رِسَالَاتِ اللَّهِ وَلَا يَخْشَوْنَ أَحَدًا إِلَّا اللَّهَ
(Those who convey the messages of Allah and do not fear anyone except Allah.)
- Quran, Surah Al-Ahzab (33), Verse 39

Those people do not fear anyone at all except Allah. So, they do not panic or fear Iblis, wondering what will happen, what will be. Nothing will happen. Nothing. Rest assured.

And these scholars prevent:

وَأَنْ يُسَلِّطَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِبْلِيسَ وَشِيعَتَهُ النَّوَاصِبَ
(And that Iblis and his Shia Nasibis should gain dominance over them.)
- [Reference needed]

And they prevent Iblis and his Nasibi Shias – Nasibis, who are the enemies of Shias – from gaining dominance over them, meaning the Shias of Ahlul Bayt. That they should not dominate them.

#### 4.3. The Superiority of Defending Faith Over Physical Jihad

So this is the work of Shia scholars. To stand firmly against the Nasibis. To openly confront them. And to prevent Shias from falling into their hands.

عَلَا فَمَنِ انْتَسَبَ لِذَلِکَ مِنْ شِيعَتِنَا كَانَ أَفْضَلَ مِمَّنْ جَاهَدَ الرُّومَ وَالتُّرْكَ وَالْخَزَرَ أَلْفَ أَلْفَ مَرَّةٍ لِأَنَّهُ يَدْفَعُ عَنْ أَدْيَانِ مُحِبِّينَا
(Indeed, whoever aligns himself with that from among our Shias, he is better than one who waged jihad against the Romans, Turks, and Khazars a thousand thousand times, because he defends the religions of our lovers.)
- [Reference needed]

Pay attention to the words. That Shia who `nasb` (establishes) himself, `nasb` means to stand up in front, that is called `nasb`. Saying, "I am I, whatever you want to say, say it. What do you want to do? With whom do you want to talk? Come, face me in opposition." If someone among our Shias does this work, he is better than that `mujahid` (warrior) who waged a million jihads (a thousand thousand times), against whom? Against the Romans, meaning the Romans, against the Turks, and against the Khazars – this one act of his is better than a million jihads. This one act. Such a great virtue. Meaning, taking care of Shias. This is respect for Ahlul Bayt. It is essential to protect them. Because this `alim` (scholar), یَدْفَعُ عَنْ أَدْيَانِ مُحِبِّينَا (he defends the religions of our lovers). He – meaning this scholar – protects the religion of our lovers; he defends the religion. And that `mujahid` who waged a million jihads, he is protecting their bodies. And there can be no comparison between the body and religion.

Commander of the Faithful repeatedly said:

أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ دِينَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ
(O people, your religion, your religion!)
- Nahj al-Balagha, Sermon 183

O people, protect your religion. Even if your wealth, your possessions, your life goes for it. Even if your life goes for it. It's clear, isn't it? Meaning, it is a reality that life has no value compared to religion. And all the martyrs among us who gave their lives, they gave them for this very reason, didn't they? All the Imams sacrificed their lives for religion, didn't they? All the Imams were martyred for what? For religion. The great scholars who were martyred, for what were they martyred? For religion.

#### 4.4. Historical Example: Mirza Muhammad Kashmiri Sahib

Mirza Muhammad Kashmiri Sahib converted from Sunni to Shia. He converted from Sunni to Shia. And once he became Shia and saw the truth, he saw once and for all that this is the truth. Then, as soon as Muhaddith Dehlvi wrote the book `Tuhfat al-Ithna Ashariyyah` (A Gift to the Twelvers), he immediately replied to it. He replied in 15 volumes at a time when Muhaddith Dehlvi was still alive. Muhaddith Dehlvi was alive, and then he replied. And he named the book `Nuzhat al-Ithna Ashariyyah` (The Purity of the Twelvers). Muhaddith Dehlvi wrote `Tuhfat al-Ithna Ashariyyah`, and Mirza Muhammad Kashmiri replied with `Nuzhat al-Ithna Ashariyyah`. Meaning, declaring the Twelvers pure. Muhaddith Dehlvi called it a gift; Mirza Muhammad Kashmiri said this is purity. And he himself was first Sunni, then became Shia. And of the 15 volumes, unfortunately, as is repeatedly said, for those who listen, one peculiar thing about us Shias is that we don't preserve our inheritance; we immediately squander our inheritance. It's clear, isn't it? In this, they speak like Shias, but they act like those people, so much so that Commander of the Faithful had to say that "I see my inheritance being plundered." Similarly, this book also completely disappeared; only five volumes of it remain.

When he wrote this book, Muhaddith Dehlvi immediately had no answer. When he couldn't find any answer, to whom did he go? To Abdur Rahman, لعنت اللہ علیہ (may Allah curse him). Who was the Nawab of Jhajjar; Jhajjar is still there in Haryana. There's a place called Jhajjar. He went to this Nawab, and upon going to the Nawab, Muhaddith Dehlvi said – this Abdur Rahman was also a great, meaning, `waleed al-zina` (illegitimate child) – yes, he was rather `Abd al-Shaytan` (slave of Satan). He was the Nawab of Jhajjar. This Pataudi family, right? This Pataudi. This is the same family, the same family. Their Nawab. Same family. They were all very despicable individuals. Even today, you can see their actions and understand. So he went to him and said, "Look, he has written a book; now what?" So first he said, "Well, write a reply." He said, "There is no reply to this." He did this, he did that, whatever was said, whatever was written, he just went to him. So then he asked, "Then what?" He said, "If this book becomes widespread, then people will all abandon the religion of Abu Bakr. They will abandon the religion of Umar. What should we do?" He said, "Okay. Let's make some arrangements." He did this because Mirza Muhammad Kashmiri Sahib was a `hakeem` (traditional physician/scholar). So he was summoned, meaning, he was called saying, "Hakeem Sahib, the Nawab Sahib is unwell." And after being summoned, he went. And he befriended them very much, saying, "The Nawab Sahib's medicine was very beneficial; please come for dinner again, come for dinner again." Anyway, the summary is that in the end, three or four times, he poisoned the food, and he was martyred. His grave is still in Delhi.

It's Panja Sharif, isn't it? In Delhi. The Fourth Martyr. Whenever you go to Delhi, if you get a chance, please do visit his grave. He rendered great service to the Shias. After becoming Shia, he rendered great service. People generally, of course, those from Delhi and around Delhi, visit his grave and highly revere him, but we are not familiar with him. So Panja Sharif is still present. And the people of Delhi say – I don't know – the people there say that great miracles and wonders happen there. So these were the companions who gave their lives. If they had practiced `taqiyyah` and sat quietly, because in Delhi, you know that in Delhi, we are talking about 20 years, 15 years ago, right? Shia processions didn't even come out in Delhi out of fear. We are talking about 15-20 years ago. So in that era, the whole of Delhi—what did Aurangzeb do? Let me tell you a little about this too. What did Aurangzeb do? Because Delhi was the capital, wasn't it? So he completely emptied Delhi of Sayyids, of Shias, especially of Sayyids. And what did he do to all of them? He threw everyone 50, 100, 200 kilometers away from Delhi. That's why if you go around Delhi, there are more than 100 villages with "Sayyid" attached to their names. Like Naugawa Sayyids, Sirsi Sayyids, Pinderi Sayyids. All of these were Sayyids whom Aurangzeb threw out so they wouldn't come back there. So they wouldn't come to Delhi, and he even gave them their own land outside so they could farm there and do all those things. Anyway, they stood their ground and bravely confronted them, giving their lives. And they were martyred. And similarly, there was Shaheed Sarrah – God willing, his mention will be on another occasion – and in this way, the martyrs gave their lives.

So actual `ulama` are those who are brave like this, who are not afraid of anyone. They are the real `ulama`. Those who are not cowards; those who are cowards are not scholars; they cannot be Shia scholars, they might be something else. He is a Shia scholar. The true Shia scholar is one who speaks openly. This morning, when a scholar sent his debate to TV, we were happy; although it might not have been very scholarly, at least he stood against three goats and was thoroughly thrashing those people, meaning with courage, without fear, anyway.

### 5. The Message of Karbala: Imam Husayn's Departure from Medina

So this is the message Sayyid al-Shuhada (Imam Husayn) gave. This is the message of Karbala that is presented. And that is why when Sayyid al-Shuhada (Imam Husayn) came and said to Lady Zaynab, "Sister Zaynab, Medina is no longer fit to live in. Now prepare, the 28th of Safar has arrived."

#### 5.1. The Sadness of Medina

Abdullah ibn Sinan says that he was in Medina on the day Husayn ibn Ali departed from Medina. Husayn ibn Ali departed from Medina, and I saw that the people of Medina were very disheartened, very sad. I asked, "What is the reason for this sadness?" They said, "Are you a traveler?" I said, "I am from Kufa." They said, "Don't you know Husayn ibn Ali is leaving Medina? Husayn ibn Ali is leaving Medina." Abdullah ibn Sinan said, "I thought I would stay and watch how the people of Medina bid farewell to Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family."

#### 5.2. The Respectful Departure of the Ladies of Ahlul Bayt

Abdullah ibn Sinan says that he came and stood outside Bayt al-Sharif, where a large crowd had gathered, quite a crowd. After a while, two young men emerged from Bayt al-Sharif, came out, and pushed the crowd away, saying, "Move away, move away." "Move away, the Prophet's daughters, peace be upon him and his holy family, are coming out, the Prophet's daughters are coming out, the Prophet's daughters are about to mount, the camels are coming." Just by saying this, they pushed the crowd away. The crowd moved, a camel came, a lady mounted, and the camel started to move. A little later, another lady came, and thus, the ladies were mounting. Suddenly, a lady came, and a strapping young man was helping her mount. I asked, "Who is this?" They said, "This is the orphan of Hasan (peace be upon them), Qasim. He is helping his mother, Umm Farwa, mount."

Now, after a little while, what did I see? When a lady emerged, a thin but well-built young man was with her. He drew back the curtain of the litter and helped the lady mount with great respect and reverence. I asked, "Who is this?" They said, "This is Husayn's son, the one who resembles the Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, Ali Akbar, helping his mother, Umm Layla, mount."

Now, after a little while, what did I see? When a lady emerged, a thin but well-built young man was with her. He drew back the curtain of the litter and helped the lady mount with great respect and reverence. I asked, "Who is this?" They said, "This is Lady Umm Kulthum, the younger daughter of Commander of the Faithful, and the one helping her mount is Commander of the Faithful's son, Abbas. Commander of the Faithful's son, Abbas."

Up until now, while the ladies were mounting the camels, Husayn was sitting on a chair overseeing the arrangements. Abdullah ibn Sinan writes that as soon as one lady emerged, Husayn stood up from his chair, and all the young men of Banu Hashim stepped forward. Someone held his sandals, someone drew back the curtain of the litter, someone held her arm. They helped her mount with great respect and reverence. I asked, "Who is this?" They said, "This is the elder daughter of Commander of the Faithful, Zaynab."

#### 5.3. Abbas's Role and the Foreshadowing of Ashura

The speaker then addresses the young men of Banu Hashim, saying, "Oh, with such great respect you helped Zaynab mount today! Just come on the 11th of Muharram and see how the wicked are making Zaynab mount bare-back camels, how they are lashing her."

When all the ladies mounted the camels and started moving, the `amari` (howdahs) started moving, the procession of `amari` started moving. Suddenly, Husayn said to Abbas:

يَا عَبَّاسُ قَدِّمْ جَوَادِي
(O Abbas, bring forth my steed.)
- [Reference needed]

O Abbas, bring my steed, bring my horse. Hazrat Abbas brought the horse of Husayn ibn Ali and helped Imam Husayn, peace be upon him, mount. And the speaker says with great reverence, "O Abul Fazl, O Master Abbas, today you are helping him mount, what will happen on the `Asr-e-Ashura` (Afternoon of Ashura)? When Husayn will say:

حَيَّكُمْ يُقَدِّمُ جَوَادِي
(Who among you will bring forth my steed?)
- [Reference needed]

O my lions, who will help me mount? No one will come from the battlefield, but the sister will come out, "Brother, do not fear, Zaynab is still alive, Zaynab will help you mount."

و سيعلم الذين ظلموا أی منقلب ینقلبون
(And those who have wronged will come to know to what [kind of] return they will return.)
- Quran, Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26), Verse 227

### 📌 Principles and Insights Taught

| Principle Discussed | Concise Summary of Key Point |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| **Patience and Divine Trust** | Enduring hardship for Allah's sake ensures divine affairs are managed through and for the believers, rather than falling into the hands of oppressors. |
| **The Nature of Doubt (`Shubh`)** | Doubt resembles truth, making it difficult for the undiscerning to distinguish falsehood, unlike `Awliya Allah` who are guided by certainty and the true path. |
| **Dangers of Uncontrolled Desires** | Succumbing to `shahawat` (lusts) and refusing to self-reproach leads one to deep impurities and shifts allegiance from Ahlul Bayt to Satan. |
| **Vulnerability of Weak Believers** | When strong believers fail to defend the faith, weak Shias become susceptible to enslavement, economic oppression, and misguidance by enemies of the Ahlul Bayt. |
| **The Elevated Role of Shia Scholars** | True Shia scholars are spiritual guardians (`murabitun`) at the frontier, bravely defending the faith and beliefs of weak Shias against satanic and Nasibi influences, a task superior to physical jihad. |
