### Introduction to the Quranic Verse: Surah Al-A'raf, Verse 199

The noble verse chosen for this discourse is verse number 199 of Surah Al-A'raf, which is the seventh chapter of the Quran, named Al-A'raf. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is commanding the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family. Allah is commanding the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, and actually, this is not just for the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, but for all of us. Imam Sadiq, peace be upon them, said:

**ما انزل الله القران الا بایاك اعني واسمعي يا جارة**
Allah did not reveal the Quran except with the proverb: 'I mean you, so listen, O neighbor.'
- [Reference needed]

This is a saying of the Sixth Imam. Allah did not reveal the Quran except with this شعار (motto), this proverb. The Imam states, with this proverb:

**ایاك اعني و اسمي يا جارة**
I mean you, so listen, O neighbor.
- [Reference needed]

Meaning, "I am speaking to you, but listen, O neighbor!" This means that in many places, the address is to the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, but actually, Allah's intention is for other people. For example, to make the point clear for children (elders already understand). For example, Allah said in the verse of Ghadir, which you recite:

**يا أيها الرسول بلغ ما أنزل إليك من ربك ۖ وإن لم تفعل فما بلغت رسالته ۚ والله يعصمك من الناس**
O Messenger, announce that which has been revealed to you from your Lord; and if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message. And Allah will protect you from the people.
- [Reference needed]

So, apparently, the address is to the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family. It says, 'O Messenger, convey this message of Wilayah (guardianship).' If you do not convey the message of Wilayah (guardianship), it is as if you have not performed any part of your prophethood's mission. So, actually, this is indeed addressed to us. That if you have done everything, but if there is no Wilayah (guardianship), what can I say, marvelous! If there is no Wilayah (guardianship), then you have done nothing. So all your deeds are zero. And don't worry about Wilayah (guardianship); don't worry, **والله يعصمك من الناس** (And Allah will protect you from the people.). Allah will protect you from the evil of people, meaning, 'evil' here implies there were some mischievous people from whom Allah was providing guarantee.

### Analysis of the Three Commands in Surah Al-A'raf, Verse 199

So this is a very important verse of the Quran, which you all have just recited, that Allah is saying:

**خذ العفو**
Hold to forgiveness
- [Reference needed]

as the first thing. That is, this verse has three commands; it is a small verse, but it actually has only six words. But there are three main commands. And what are those commands? The very first is:

**خذ العفو**
Hold to forgiveness
- [Reference needed]

So, what is its apparent meaning? Make forgiveness your motto, meaning, make it your habit. To forgive people. Forgive whoever makes a mistake, forgive whoever does wrong. **خذ العفو** (Hold to forgiveness), just keep forgiving. Actually, we will explain the implications further now. First, let's translate the verse. And then the second part says:

**وأمر بالعرف**
and command what is customary
- [Reference needed]

**وأمر** (and command), meaning, 'command,' and give people orders for what purpose? **بالعرف** (what is customary). This part, **وأمر بالعرف** (and command what is customary), God willing, we will discuss these two words for five days. If Allah grants us success and life. So if Allah grants us success and life, we will discuss these two words: what **وأمر بالعرف** (and command what is customary) means. You will command **عرف** (customary). God willing, we will explain it.

**وأعرض عن الجاهلين**
and turn away from the ignorant
- [Reference needed]

is the third order. And when the **جاهل** (ignorant person) addresses you, when an ignorant person starts speaking, turn away. There is no benefit in talking to an ignorant person. Here, 'ignorant' does not mean someone who lacks knowledge. Look, when the Arabic word **جاہل** (ignorant person) is used, it has two opposites. One opposite of the word **جاہل** (ignorant person) is **عالم** (learned person), and the other opposite of **جاہل** (ignorant person) is **عاقل** (wise person). So, if **جاہل** (ignorant person) means someone who does not know, then that's fine; many people do not know many things. In this context, only Allah, His Messenger, peace be upon him and his holy family, and the Imam are the **عالم** (learned person). But the second type of **جاہل** (ignorant person) is someone who acts against reason. That intellect which Allah has given to everyone. God willing, if Allah grants success, there will be some discussion on this.

So there are three commands in this verse. First, forgive people. Grant pardon. Meaning, we cling to a past incident, something that happened ten or twenty years ago, and in many places, disputes continue through generations. For example, 'His grandfather did this to our grandfather, so today we will not talk to them.' Is that clear? Or, Allah is commanding you: **خذ العفو** (Hold to forgiveness).

### Elaboration on *Khudh al-Afw* (Hold to Forgiveness and Gentleness)

So, one meaning of **عفو** (forgiveness) is to forgive. And another meaning of **عفو** (forgiveness) is to deal with gentleness. To deal with tenderness and gentleness. And Allah has also commanded the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, regarding this in the Quran. In another verse, which is verse number 159 of Surah Al-Imran, Allah says:

**فبما رحمة من الله لنت لهم**
So by mercy from Allah, you were lenient with them.
- [Reference needed]

This is Allah's mercy upon you that you are dealing with such gentleness. You deal with them so politely, so softly. This is the mercy of the Lord, because the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, was **رحمة للعالمين** (a mercy to the worlds). The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, was a mercy for everyone, which is why the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, spoke gently. The Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, spoke softly. This was the method of the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family. And from this, one can tell who follows the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, and who does not. From a person's way of speaking, it becomes evident who is truly a Muslim and who is not. A person who naturally speaks by shouting and uses abusive language in every conversation, understand that they are Muslim in name only. But in practice, they are nothing. They are zero, because an actual Muslim means someone who fully submits. That is what a Muslim is called. Someone who adopts not only verbally but even the conduct and character of the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family.

So remember, what is Allah saying in the Quran now?

**فبما رحمة من الله لنت لهم**
So by mercy from Allah, you were lenient with them.
- [Reference needed]

**لنت** (you were lenient) in Arabic is derived from **لنت** (you were lenient) or **لين** (lenient), meaning extremely soft. Something that is very soft is called **لين** (lenient) in Arabic. Meaning, the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, was extremely soft. So soft that Allah gave an example elsewhere in the Quran, saying that when you commit audacity against the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, only then does the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, feel modesty to say something to you. That is, Allah says in the Quran about the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, that you commit audacity against him. But Allah says that he feels modesty, but I will not. Allah says, 'On his behalf, I will condemn you.' Did you pay attention? So look, what is the verse?

**فبما رحمة من الله لنت لهم ۚ ولو كنت فظا غليظ القلب لانفضوا من حولك**
So by mercy from Allah, you were lenient with them. And if you had been rude [in speech] and harsh in heart, they would have disbanded from about you.
- [Reference needed]

O Prophet, if you had been **فظ** (rude). **فظ** (rude) means rude. In English, it's called rude. If you had been rude and ill-spoken, your tongue would have been foul. **فظ** (rude) and **غليظ القلب** (harsh in heart), and if your heart had been filled only with malice, hatred, animosity, and enmity and all these things, then no one would come near you; everyone would stay away from you. Now, its interpretation is different, which I don't know if I can explain or not, but I will explain it anyway.

So the first part is for the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, that the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, was very gentle, and that is why people gathered around him. And the second part, **فظا غليظ القلب** (rude and harsh in heart), in our interpretations, refers to that 'other big old man' who always walked with a stick in hand. And he would only keep scolding people and would not spare anyone except by shouting and yelling. He would even intrude among women and beat them. That is, someone passed away, and women were crying. He entered among the women and started beating them, saying that crying is perhaps an innovation. And these were all his actions. This is the second part. God willing, we will explain this further if Allah grants success. So this is the verse.

### Elaboration on *Amr bil Ma'ruf* (Enjoining what is Customary/Right)

So you see, the verse we just recited, **خذ العفو** (Hold to forgiveness). Meaning, forgive people. **وأمر بالعرف** (and command what is customary). And command **عرف** (customary). What does **عرف** (customary) mean? **عرف** (customary) means **معروف** (good/known). You say "enjoining what is right," don't you? So Allah is commanding the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family. There are many verses in the Quran about enjoining what is right. For example, in Surah At-Tawbah, the characteristic of believers is stated:

**المؤمنون بالمعروف والناهون عن المنكر**
The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong.
- [Reference needed]

What is the sign of a believer? They enjoin what is right, meaning people always command goodness and forbid evil. This is the sign of a believer. And when it came to hypocrites, what does the Quran say about hypocrites? That they are the ones who command evil and prevent people from goodness. So if someone does this, understand that they are a hypocrite. These are verses from Surah At-Tawbah. Or, for example, the verse from Surah Luqman. Hazrat Luqman, who was a very great sage, told his son:

**يا بني أقم الصلاة**
O my son, establish prayer
- [Reference needed]

"Look, establish prayer. Establish prayer."

**وأمر بالمعروف**
and enjoin what is right
- [Reference needed]

"and enjoin what is right."

**وانها عن المنكر**
and forbid what is wrong
- [Reference needed]

"and forbid evil. Stop people from evil."

**واصبر على ما أصابك**
and be patient over what befalls you.
- [Reference needed]

"and be patient over whatever calamity befalls you." And then Hazrat Luqman says:

**إن ذلك من عزم الأمور**
Indeed, that is of the matters [requiring] determination.
- [Reference needed]

These four tasks are very tough, very difficult, not easy. Prayer is a difficult task, enjoining what is right is difficult, forbidding what is wrong is difficult, and being patient during calamities is also difficult. Hazrat Luqman says this, the Quran said it. **واصبر على ما أصابك** (and be patient over what befalls you.).

Now, to understand what **عرف** (customary) means: Look, **عرف** (customary) means **معروف** (good/known). Generally, **عرف** (customary) means **معروف** (good/known). But in Urdu, for those familiar with Urdu, what is **عرف** (customary) called? It's something that is customary. Something that people recognize. It is called **عرف عام** (common custom). For example, a word used in Urdu is **عرف عام** (common custom). Actually, in Mumbai, the biggest problem in speaking is language. Mumbai people don't understand any single language (purely). Meaning, they understand everything mixed. That's why one has to speak a bit mixed there. Then, when one speaks mixed, and the video goes somewhere else, they ask, 'What language were they using?' Similarly, if we go and speak somewhere else, they say, 'We watched your video, what language were you speaking?' I said, 'Brother, that language is for our audience. It's not necessary for you because it's for educated people who are good at Urdu.'

### The Definition and Characteristics of *Ma'ruf* (Good/Known)

Now, what does **عرف** (customary) mean? **معروف** (good/known). Look, now we are coming to our point. What is **معروف** (good/known) called? Look, **معروف** (good/known). First and foremost, **معروف** (good/known) refers to something that a person accepts, meaning their intellect accepts it, their intellect deems it correct. This is the first thing. Intellect accepts it. Intellect says, 'Yes, this is correct.' We will give you an example. And what is its second condition? That the person who does it enjoys doing it. When they do that work, they enjoy doing it. We will give an example.

Look, intellect should accept it. For example, there is something called intellect. Look, when we say 'intellect,' remember this. It should be something that everyone accepts. Yes. Whether they are Hindu, Muslim, Christian, or Sikh, it should be acceptable to them. They will accept it. For example, speaking the truth. Is there any religion in the world that says to lie? Is there any such religion that says to lie? No religion says to lie. After that, people justify it. The liar justifies it. But actually, if you look, every law in the world has a common principle, and that is perjury. What does perjury mean? Lying in court. It is considered a very big sin. And when any witness is brought, it is said to them beforehand, isn't it? They place their hand on their religious book and say, 'Will I tell a lie?' No, 'I will tell the truth and nothing but the truth.' That's why a witness is brought. And that's how they testify. Has anyone heard of any court in the world today where it is said you can lie? Nowhere. In any religion in the world.

So, what is the definition of **عرف** (customary)? The definition of **عرف** (customary) is this. **عرف** (customary) is that which intellect accepts. One. And any religion. And secondly, the doer should like doing it, should feel good about it. For example, a child. He played a prank. He did something in the house. For example, he broke a glass. He was playing cricket, and the glass broke while he was playing with the ball. Then the father came. Daddy came home. Daddy asked, 'Who broke the glass?' He says, 'Daddy, it was me.' He is scared, he is scared. But the parents had trained him such that no matter how big a sin he commits, he should never lie. So now, when he speaks, he tells the truth: 'Daddy, it was me. I made a mistake.' Now look, the truth he is speaking, his father accepts it, this boy accepts it, he also feels good, and the father also feels good that his son speaks the truth. No matter what happens. Or, let's give another example: if there is an employee in any company. If anything, meaning if the owner or manager sees that something went wrong, he asks, 'Who did this?' If the employee says, 'Sir, I did it; I made a mistake,' then their credibility increases. Why? Because they are very honest; they never lie and always own up to their mistakes.

### Ma'rifat (Recognition) as the Supreme *Ma'ruf*

So, what is **معروف** (good/known) called? Firstly, something that intellect accepts, and secondly, something that one enjoys doing. That is why, in light of traditions, among all **معروف** (good/known) deeds, what is the most important **معروف** (good/known)? It is **معرفت اللہ** (knowledge of Allah). It is the knowledge of Allah. To recognize Allah. That's why it is said that this knowledge (ma'rifat) is a pleasure, a supreme pleasure. Greater pleasure is not found in anything else.

And what is its example? For instance, a person who is very thirsty. Imagine, during Ramadan, you fast in the summer season, and you are extremely thirsty. You are very, very thirsty. Now, when it's time to break the fast, at the moment you break it... and you are almost dying of thirst. At that moment, when you drink water—water that is neither too cold nor too hot—which is called **آبِ گوارا** (pleasant water), meaning, pleasant water. When you drink it, how much pleasure do you get? Similarly, the person who recognizes Allah, who has the right to recognize Him, experiences the same pleasure from the knowledge of Allah. They get the same pleasure from recognizing the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family. They get the same pleasure from recognizing their Imam.

### The Steadfastness of Janab Qambar: An Example of True Ma'rifat

And that is why, whoever recognized the Imam, whoever truly recognized him, they recognized him in such a way that they were ready to give their life. That is why, look, when it was the time of Hajjaj ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi, **لعنت اللہ علیہ** (May Allah's curse be upon him). You know, he was a very malicious person. It was his era, his time. And he used to seek out Shias to kill them. So he told his man, he asked, 'Is there anyone who loves the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) right now? I'm in the mood to kill such a person today.' He asked, 'Who?' He said, 'Qambar.' He said, 'Bring him.'

Now, Janab Qambar was very old at that time. Very frail. But look, if a person's faith is young, then they never grow old. Is that clear? That's why the Imam wants to say, let me narrate a Hadith.

**الْعَاقِلُ اِذَا شَابَ شَبَّ عَقْلُهٗ**
When a wise person ages, his intellect becomes youthful.
- [Reference needed]

When a **عاقل** (wise person) grows old, his intellect remains young. A wise person, right? A person of faith. A wise person, meaning a person of faith. When they grow old, their intellect remains young.

**وَالْجَاهِلُ اِذَا شَابَ شَبَّ جَهْلُهٗ**
And when an ignorant person ages, his ignorance becomes youthful.
- [Reference needed]

And when a **جاہل** (ignorant person) grows old, their ignorance becomes youthful. That's why you see all politicians, whether they are these politicians, politicians. No matter how old they get, they won't leave politics. Those who love the chair (of power), they are not ready to leave it, no matter how old they get. Their feet are hanging in the grave. But they won't leave it. Is that clear? We have a saying here:

قسم قرآن کی مؤمنی شیر مر جائی مگر گھاس نہ کھائی
By the Quran, a believer, even if a lion dies, will not eat grass.
- [Reference needed]

A lion will die but won't eat grass. Oh, they won't leave that chair, no matter what happens. They are not leaving the chair, no matter how old they get: 90 years, 92 years, 93 years. They won't leave the chair until someone 'drops' them. That's why in politics, people keep 'dropping' each other. And the same happened in Islam. Don't think that they just martyred the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, and sat content. No. We don't want to teach history right now, God willing, some other time. Everyone was killing each other. No one among them died a natural death after the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family. Understand this. When I say 'anyone,' I mean anyone who came to power. Only the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) was not martyred. All those who became rulers after the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family. Is that clear to you? And the killer was the one who became ruler later. Understand the principle. That is, this is a principle, yes, brother. Understand this as a definite, absolute, historical fact.

So he called Janab Qambar. After calling Janab Qambar, when he was called, Janab Qambar came. Very old, frail. But his faith was solid. He asked, 'Is your name Abu Hamdan?' Abu Hamdan was Janab Qambar's kunya (agnomen). Then Janab Qambar said:

**نَعَم**
Yes.
- [Reference needed]

He said, 'Are you the slave of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin)?' **مولا** (master/slave) means slave. But in Arabic, **مولا** (master/slave) has two meanings. **مولا** (master/slave) means both master and slave. Do you understand? That is why, when you translate the Hadith of Ghadir, translate it correctly. We usually translate it incorrectly.

**اللّٰہُمَّ وَالِ مَنْ وَالَا**
O Allah, befriend whoever befriends him
- [Reference needed]

'whoever takes the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) as a friend, then befriend him.' This is a wrong translation. If you translate it this way, then those people are correct in saying that the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family, was merely announcing friendship. This translation is wrong. Its translation should be:

**اللّٰہُمَّ وَالِ مَنْ وَالَا**
O Allah, make him your servant who takes Ali as his master.
- [Reference needed]

O Lord, take him as Your servant who takes the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) as his Master. Whoever takes the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) as his Master, then take him as Your servant. This is what **اللّٰہُمَّ وَالِ مَنْ وَالَا** (O Allah, make him your servant who takes Ali as his master) means. Otherwise, if you say 'friend,' then we have been saying and debating this for so long, and then you give this translation. So, translate very carefully. Anyway.

Now, what did he ask? 'Are you a slave of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin)?' Janab Qambar replied, look: whoever stays at the door of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) is educated. They possess knowledge (ma'rifat). At the door of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) and the children of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), there are no ignorant people. There are no ignorant people. They are educated, excellent speakers, and brave. They don't fear anyone. So Janab Qambar, in such old age, did not think, 'Let me live in peace for a few more days. Live comfortably.' No, what was his reply? Now listen to the reply. The answer of a person of knowledge. He said:

**اللّٰہُ مَولَایَا وَأَمِیْرُ الْمُوْمِنِیْنَ عَلِیُّ بْنُ اَبِیْ طَالِبٍ وَلِیُّ نِعْمَتِیْ**
Allah is my Master, and the Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abi Talib, is the guardian of my blessings.
- [Reference needed]

My God is Allah. But the blessings He bestowed upon me, He gave them through the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin). See what knowledge this is. He bestowed blessings upon me through the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin). Now he flared up; he used to get very angry. Especially when Hajjaj would do all this, he would usually finish it in a state of drunkenness. At that time, he would get very angry. When he heard this answer, then do you know what the habit of those people was, all those big kings? What was their habit? To hear 'yes sir'. Now if someone replied like that, it was not their habit to hear it. So he asked, he ordered, 'Disassociate from the religion of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin).' Disassociate from the religion of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin). Disassociate. Disassociate, saying you hate the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin). So Qambar replied: 'I will,' listen to my answer now, 'I will, if you can bring a better religion than that of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin).' A better religion than the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin)'s. Look, a comparative study. Wasn't it a comparative study? Within one single sentence, a complete comparative study took place. 'Bring forth a better religion than that of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin).' The Quran says:

**فَبُهِتَ الَّذِي كَفَرَ**
So the one who disbelieved was confounded.
- [Reference needed]

The disbeliever was stunned, bewildered and confounded. He did not know what hit him. He said, 'Alright, then prepare for death.' Qambar said, 'No problem.' Now look at his arrogance. Now arrogance was speaking loudly. 'By what method do you wish to die now?' He said, 'I leave that to you. Kill me however you wish.' He asked, 'Why?' He said, 'My Master, the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), had said that your killer, Qambar, will kill you in the same way you kill him during the Raj'at (return).' Is that clear? Look at the level of faith. He said, 'Alright, I will slaughter you the way sheep and goats are slaughtered.' Qambar said, and it is written in the Hadith:

**فَذَبَحَهُ**
So he slaughtered him.
- [Reference needed]

He slaughtered him and, just as they cut things into pieces, he cut Qambar into pieces. He was already drunk anyway. So this is the level. This is called 'ma'rifat' (knowledge). But you see, till the last moment, Qambar remained steadfast on his religion. Till the last moment. And he was rather enjoying it. That Allah granted him the privilege to be martyred for the sake of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin). You see, this is the level of faith. Now, for example, if a person like us receives even a slight threat, they would say, 'No, brother, whatever you say, we are performing taqiyya (dissimulation).' Meaning, this has happened as a fact. That now, in one class, when we were teaching Hadith, a student himself asked, 'Sir, shouldn't they have performed taqiyya (dissimulation)?' We said, 'Brother, their level was not your level.'

Brother, taqiyya (dissimulation) has five rulings. There are five laws for everything. We are not saying this; Sheikh Murtadha Ansari wrote it in his book. Taqiyya (dissimulation) can be obligatory, recommended, disliked, forbidden, or permissible. If there is a fear of losing religion, then taqiyya (dissimulation) is forbidden. And if there is a danger of the destruction of generations, then taqiyya (dissimulation) is forbidden. Taqiyya (dissimulation) is forbidden in that case. Otherwise, why were all our great scholars martyred? They were all martyred for this very reason: they knew that if they performed taqiyya (dissimulation) today, generations would be ruined, and the religion of generations would be lost. Shahid Awwal (First Martyr), Sheikh Muhammad Makki. Shahid Thani (Second Martyr), Sheikh Zayn al-Din al-Amili. Shahid Thalith (Third Martyr), Qazi Nurullah Shushtari. Shahid Rabi' (Fourth Martyr), Mirza Muhammad Kamil Kashmiri in Delhi. God willing, we will narrate their story too. All these people gave their lives. And they gave their lives willingly; it's not that they were killed by deceit. No! They gave their lives, knowing that if they did this, it would be **معروف** (good/known).

### The Imam's Guidance: Criteria for True Faith

So that's why, look, the definition of **معروف** (good/known) is clear now, so that when we discuss it further, God willing, we will continue based on this. So now the definition of **معروف** (good/known) is that it is something which intellect accepts and which a person enjoys doing. That is why, listen now, a very important point for you. In the Quran, in Hadith, in legal rulings, in the fatwas of scholars and jurists, have you ever seen or heard **اَمْر بِالْوَاجِب** (enjoining the obligatory)? Have you heard **نَھِی عَنِ الْحَرَامْ** (forbidding the forbidden)? Have you heard it anywhere? What is written? **اَمْر بِالْ مَعْرُوْفْ** (enjoining what is right), **نَھِی عَنِ الْ مُنْکَرْ** (forbidding what is wrong). Meaning, command that which intellect accepts and which one enjoys doing. And forbid that which is against intellect and which one does not enjoy doing. Meaning, it should be against intellect, yes.

That's why, if we preach religion, this is a very important point. Look, why do people run away from religion? Why do they get annoyed by religion? They run away for this very reason. Because we directly tell them about the branches of religion. This is the reason. Don't directly tell them about the branches of religion. First, tell them about the fundamentals of religion. First, tell them who Allah is? Who is the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family? Who is the Imam? When he gains knowledge of them, then he will follow. Otherwise, he will not follow.

So look, what is stated in the narrations, what is in the Hadith? Now listen carefully to what the Hadith of the Imam says.

**لَا تَنْظُرُوا إِلَى كَثْرَةِ صَلَاتِهِمْ وَ صَوْمِهِمْ وَ كَثْرَةِ الْحَجِّ وَ الْمَعْرُوفِ وَ تَنْتَنَتِهِمْ بِاللَّيْلِ**
Do not look at the abundance of their prayers, their fasting, their numerous pilgrimages, their acts of kindness, and their crying at night.
- [Reference needed]

Do not look at their abundant prayers. The Imam states. Do not look at abundant prayers, do not look at abundant fasting. Do not look at abundant pilgrimages. Oh, he prays a lot. He fasts a lot. He performs many pilgrimages, so many pilgrimages. He has done all these things so many times. He spends a lot, he gives to people. He is very generous. He performs excellent **نمازِ شب** (night prayer). We can give examples for each one. For prayer and fasting, the best example was that of the Khawarij. It is written in history books that the Khawarij prayed so much that a mark of prostration formed on their foreheads, like the knee of a camel. Have you ever seen a camel's knee? Suddenly, how the whole camel is yellow, but its knee is black. Because when a camel sits, due to sitting, its knee becomes black because it stands up and sits down. So, the example given in history is that the Khawarij prostrated so much that their foreheads became like camels' knees. They prayed so much. They fasted so much. But when the Battle of Siffin occurred and the opponents raised the Quran (on spears), the Master of the Universe (Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin)) said, 'This is not the Quran; these are just such books, they have no value.' The Quran did not descend below their throats. But these people who did not have the knowledge of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin). They said, 'No, we will not accept it.' And in the end, those very people were the ones who killed the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin). These were the same people, of course, who did it on the orders of someone else, as I mentioned at the beginning. The one who became ruler later, that was the same system. Is that clear to you?

Let me give you another example, of Hajj. Hajj should be performed, we are not saying it shouldn't be. This doesn't mean prayers shouldn't be performed. Praying, fasting, all are obligatory. But until there is the guardianship of the Imam, until there is the guardianship of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), all this is useless. Why? Because the guardianship of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin) is the spirit of worship. If worship is without spirit, it will be dead worship. It has no value or worth. Even that worship will not be called by its name, just as you don't call a deceased person by their name. You say, 'Did the body arrive or not?' Similarly, angels will ask, 'Did the body of his prayer arrive or not?'

**وَ کَثْرَةِ الْحَجِّ**
And their numerous pilgrimages
- [Reference needed]

Now, let me give an example of Hajj. Abubasir went for Hajj. The Sixth Imam, peace be upon them, was with him. Abubasir heard so many **لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ** (Here I am, O Allah, here I am). You know how they make all sorts of sounds. Abubasir also heard that voice. Abubasir said, **مَا اَكْثَرَ الْحُجَّاج** (How many pilgrims there are!). How many pilgrims had increased so much at that time. So the Imam said, 'These are not pilgrims.' The Imam used a specific word. Abubasir said, 'Master, they are saying **لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ** (Here I am, O Allah, here I am).' So he said, 'Do you want to see?' The Imam placed his hand, his fingers, on Abubasir's eyes, and he said, 'All sorts of animals.' Different kinds of animals. Abubasir was alarmed after seeing it. He said, 'Master, make me blind again, because he was blind, wasn't he?' 'Master, make me sighted again.' So the Imam then approved. He became blind again. Why? He said, the Imam says that they came for Hajj but without the guardianship of the Imam. Without the guardianship of the Imam, there is no benefit from Hajj. No benefit at all. Until there is guardianship.

Similarly, the Imam says:

**وَتَنْتَنَتِهِمْ بِاللَّيْلِ**
and their crying at night
- [Reference needed]

What is 'tan-tanah' called in Arabic? Night, meaning tan-tanah, meaning crying loudly. Many people have this habit of crying loudly, lamenting. And **باللیل** (at night), meaning during the night. They cry very loudly, they shout a lot, they cry. The Imam says, 'Don't go by all this.' 'Don't be impressed by these things.' This also happened with the Imam, the Master of the Universe (Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin)) and Kumail. Both were walking at night from the Mosque of Kufa, past midnight, and a sound of intense crying and Quran recitation was coming from a house. He was crying while reciting the Quran. So Kumail was very impressed. He said, 'Master, this is great!' The Imam said, 'He is a dweller of hell.' 'A dweller of hell?' Kumail, look, Kumail should have accepted it then. But what was Kumail saying? 'Master, he's one of us.' 'He's our own.' The Imam gave no reply, no reply at all. But when the Battle of Nahrawan happened against the Kharijites. Then the Imam killed many people in it. It was the Imam's habit to circle around after killing, and while circling, he came to his body. And he told Kumail, **کمیل تعال ہنا** (Kumail, come here), 'Come here. Remember that night? The one who was reciting Quran and crying, this is him.' Who was killed by the sword of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin). Killed by the sword of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), by Dhul-Fiqar, and became a dweller of hell. This is him. So what should be the criterion?

The Imam says, 'Now, then, how should one recognize? Not through prayer, nor through fasting, nor through Hajj, nor through their crying. So how to recognize?' The Imam said:

**فَلَكِنْ انْظُرُوا إِلَى صِدْقِ الْحَدِيثِ وَ أَدَاءِ الْأَمَانَةِ**
But rather, look at the truthfulness of their speech and the fulfillment of their trusts.
- [Reference needed]

'See if he speaks the truth when he talks, or not? And if someone entrusts him with something, does he act with trustworthiness or not? Or does he betray the trust?' Because these two are things where religion is not considered, where faith is not considered. If you have to speak the truth, speak the truth in front of everyone, regardless of their religion or faith. Because it is the decision of intellect to speak the truth in every situation, except for certain conditions, for example, do not speak at a time when there is a dispute. There are just one or two such exceptions, nothing else. And if someone gives you something in trust, regardless of their religion or faith. But if he brought and placed a trust, then what is the usual principle of trustworthiness? To return the trust exactly as it was given. But that is not the principle in Islam. What is the principle in Islam? If someone gives a trust, return it by adding something of your own, by adding a little from your own possession. **سبحان اللہ** (Glory be to Allah). Now, what is its wisdom? Someone told us, 'Brother, I am going on a journey, please keep these 50,000 rupees for me.' We kept it. He returned from the journey and said, 'Brother, I gave you 50,000.' So, what was our task? To return the 50,000, saying 50,000 was given. What logic is this, to add something from your own side? What logic is this? Isn't it strange? The logic is that you appreciate him for considering you trustworthy. **واہ واہ** (Wow wow). **سبحان اللہ** (Glory be to Allah). He trusted you that you would not betray his trust. **واہ واہ واہ** (Wow wow wow). Why? Because he valued your religion. **واہ واہ واہ** (Wow wow wow). So tell me, does our religion teach that you should not just return the trust? But also give him some other things along with it, saying, 'Here, take this from our side as well.' Tell me, who teaches like this? Which religion does this? This is a very important thing. It is very important in enjoining what is right, and God willing, we will continue to present more details about it.

### The Role of Intellect (*Aql*) in Faith and Preaching

So the Imam says that regarding **صدق الحدیث** (truthfulness of speech), see how much intellect there is. That is why, look, a man came to the Sixth Imam, peace be upon them, and said, 'So-and-so is a Shi'a. He is excellent.' And he praised him a lot. Meaning, he prays a lot, he fasts a lot, he goes for Hajj and so on. The Imam only asked him one question. And what was that question?

**کیف عقلہ**
How is his intellect?
- [Reference needed]

How much intellect does he possess? Does he have intellect or not? It's strange, see what the question is. He is praising someone, and the Imam is asking about his intellect. So he says, 'He's only got a little bit.' The Imam said, 'Then all his deeds are useless.' Because the standard of **ثواب و عقاب** (reward and punishment), the level of reward and punishment, is according to intellect. When Allah created intellect, He said this:

**بک او بک اصیب و بک اعاقب**
By you I will reward, and by you I will punish.
- [Reference needed]

'Through you, I will give reward, and through you, I will give punishment.' Whoever uses intellect, I will reward him; whoever stays away from intellect, I will punish him. Therefore, it is very important for a person to use their intellect. And when we preach to someone, express those things that are acceptable to their intellect. If something is not acceptable to intellect, then there is no benefit in saying those things in front of them. Is that clear?

Look, when stubbornness enters something, enmity arises there. For example, there is a young girl who doesn't want to wear hijab. She says, 'I don't want to wear hijab. Why should I? No one in my college does. I don't want to wear hijab.' Now, what should we do to her? Start beating her? 'Why? You have to wear hijab, otherwise we will beat, beat, beat you!' Will she start wearing hijab by being beaten? Will it be hijab? Even if she covers herself with a chador, it won't be hijab. Brother, I am saying something very important. Hijab will be what she does thoughtfully and understandingly. If she understands it well, you have examples in front of you; you might have read in newspapers. People shaved their heads, burned hijabs, set them on fire. They did all this, right? Why did they do this? Because they were being forced. Who was forcing? The 'Enjoining what is right' Committee was doing it. Their job was to force them to wear hijab, hijab. So they burned the hijab, shaved their heads, 'take your hair, we burned it.' Here, what else do you want? Is it clear to you? People become enemies of religion. Perhaps we are unable to convey the message.

### The Commander of the Faithful's Guidance on Preaching

So listen to a Hadith, I will explain it a little, then God willing, the rest tomorrow. Listen to the Hadith, and whose saying is this Hadith? It is the saying of the Commander of the Faithful (Amir al-Mu'minin), peace be upon him. He says:

**أتحبون ألا يكذب الله ورسوله**
Do you wish that Allah and His Messenger are not denied?
- [Reference needed]

Do you wish that Allah and His Messenger, peace be upon him and his holy family, are not denied? That they are not denied, that they are not refuted, that we deny and say we don't believe in Allah, we don't believe in the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family. Do you want that to happen? Is the question understood? The Imam says, 'What am I asking?' Do you want people to become enemies of Allah and His Messenger, peace be upon him and his holy family? Of course, everyone will say no. The Imam says:

**حدثوا الناس بما يعرفون وامسكوا بما ينكرون**
Speak to people about what they know, and refrain from what they do not understand.
- [Reference needed]

**سبحان اللہ** (Glory be to Allah), **سبحان اللہ** (Glory be to Allah), **سبحان اللہ** (Glory be to Allah)! But look at what the Imam's saying is. Now, what have we done? Generally, preachers, in most places, are like that. They immediately ask the youth first, 'You don't do this? Yes, you don't do that.' Now, the poor fellow who used to come in front of the Maulana (religious scholar) also stops coming. He says, 'If I do this, they will ask in front of everyone. My honor will be lost. So let it be.' And we know one person who stopped going to the mosque. Because he did something that many people do. Meaning, **كلا سوف تعلمون ثم كلا سوف تعلمون** (Nay, you will soon come to know, then nay, you will soon come to know). It is clear he kept it absolutely clean. So they directly told him, 'Brother, why don't you keep it?' No, look, he is coming to the mosque, that's fine. Does he truly have knowledge of Allah? Does he truly have knowledge of the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family? Does he recognize religion? Does he recognize Sharia (Islamic law)? First tell him, explain to him who Allah is? Who is the Holy Prophet, peace be upon him and his holy family?

### Practical Application of Ma'rifat: Parenting and Values

Look, let me give you an example, just examples for children. Okay? A boy is walking on the road. We tell him, 'Son, please come and press my feet.' What will he immediately say? 'Am I your servant?' Will he say it or not? 'Am I your servant that I should press your feet?' But the same thing, if we tell our son. If the son is obedient and submissive. Indeed, our children are, by Allah's grace, not like that, because they are sitting here too. Okay? And they are, by Allah's grace, praise be to Allah. You tell your child, or if you feel some pain, your feet hurt, you say, 'Son, my feet hurt a lot.' The son says, 'Daddy, should I press them?' He sits and presses the feet. Why is he pressing feet? Why is he pressing feet? Why isn't the boy on the street pressing them? Why is this one pressing them? You tell me, answer yourself. He knows this is my father. He gave me birth. He endured hardships for me and is still enduring them today. Today he has come after so much hard work, doing all these things just for me. So if his feet hurt, it is obligatory for me to do at least this much for my father, isn't it? Those who know the worth of their father will certainly say, 'Daddy, as long as you say, I will keep pressing your feet.' They will tell their mother, 'As long as you say, I will keep serving you.' Why? They know their parents; they have knowledge (ma'rifat) of them. That's why they will continue to serve their parents, because they have knowledge that this is my mother, this is my father—regardless of their religion. But is religion a condition for this? Is religion a condition here? If you tell them the importance of parents, does it say, 'You are a Muslim, brother, we are telling you religion, is that how it is?' No, look at every religion, whether it's Hindu, Muslim, Christian, or Sikh. In every faith, every religion, they value their parents and serve them. Why? Because this is the decision of intellect. This is called **معروف** (good/known).

So when we bring them to the next level of **معروف** (good/known), if we explain to that girl, 'Daughter, hijab is obligatory for you so that you understand that when you go out without hijab, this male gender looks at women differently.' You don't understand, daughter; understand this, if we explain well what this male gender is, and these are not our words in the Quran. God willing, we will explain it another time; it's a verse from the Quran. The Quran says that because there is sin in their hearts, Allah tells the **ازواج نبی** (wives of the Prophet), peace be upon them, not to speak softly to them. Allah is commanding in the Quran, and this is a command for all women, not to speak softly to them; speak strictly to them. 'When they come for food, give them food and then say, "Goodbye, go."' To speak strictly, right? But nowadays, what do you teach receptionists? Isn't this what's taught? Why, brother, it's for business. Are you paying attention or not? This thing is against intellect, why? It is against intellect because it is an invitation to sin. Here, an invitation to sin is being given. And if we explain it to someone rationally like this, they will understand the point. And then at the next level, that is, Allah and His Messenger, peace be upon him and his holy family, like this. Lady **زہرا** (Zahra), peace be upon them, likes this. If you believe in Lady **زہرا** (Zahra), peace be upon them, why did Lady **زہرا** (Zahra), peace be upon them, wear hijab? She wore hijab for that reason. Every valuable thing is kept covered. Every valuable thing, if you have wealth, if you have diamonds, gold, etc., you keep it carefully in a safe. You keep it in a bank locker, you keep it safely. Do you keep it on the street? And especially if someone is in a country where, for example, we've heard this happens a lot in Africa. Have you heard that if you walk on the road wearing gold, or a valuable watch, or an expensive mobile phone, people snatch it after beating you? So, many people don't wear gold there; they come here and fulfill all their desires. We are talking about men. In Islam, gold is forbidden for men. It is adornment for women, not for men. So this is a very important thing. Every valuable thing. And similarly, God willing, we will discuss each remaining point about **معروف** (good/known). So that's why, look, this thing is not easy. This thing needs to be explained. Youth, explain it. So when you explain it to the youth, the youth will automatically be trained.

### The Ma'rifat of Death: The Example of Qasim ibn Hassan (AS)

And that is why today, we mention a young man in our lamentations whose age was only 13 years. But Sayyid al-Shuhada (Master of Martyrs) asks him a question. And what is that question? The grandson asks:

**کیف وجدت الموت؟ یا حبیبی**
How did you find death, O my beloved son?
- [Reference needed]

'Son Qasim, how did you find death?' Qasim replied:

**أَحْلَى مِنَ الْعَسَلِ**
Sweeter than honey.
- [Reference needed]

Sweeter than honey. Now, tell me one thing: if someone asks you about something, Qasim is alive, isn't he? He hasn't died yet. He hasn't tasted the cup of martyrdom yet. So how is Qasim saying? That it's sweeter than honey. So it is known that in the household of the family of Muhammad, peace be upon them, children are trained to prepare for death beforehand. O my beloved, and they don't worry about death.

That is why, on the night of Ashura, when Husayn was reciting the register of martyrdom, he mentioned everyone's name but did not mention Qasim's name. When the child saw that his name was not in the register of martyrdom, Qasim went to a corner and started crying. That his name was not in the register of martyrdom. While crying, he suddenly remembered that when his father was leaving this world, he had tied an amulet on his hand and said, 'Son, when a very great calamity befalls you, open this amulet; it will contain the solution to your problem.' As soon as Qasim opened the amulet, it was written in it:

**بني قاسم أدرك عمك الحسين**
O my son Qasim, help your uncle Husayn.
- [Reference needed]

'Son Qasim, help your uncle Husayn when Husayn is all alone in Karbala. And if he doesn't give permission, keep insisting until your uncle gives permission.' It's the night of Ashura. Qasim came with the amulet and showed his father's writing to Husayn. As soon as Husayn saw his brother's writing, Husayn said, 'Son Qasim, this is not your brother's writing; it is a message of your death.' Qasim said, 'Uncle, what should I do? It is my father's command.' Husayn consoled Qasim, 'Qasim, everyone has to die tomorrow, and Qasim, I only did not mention your name; otherwise, your name was also in the register of martyrdom, and not only yours but also your brother Ali Asghar's.'

So, on one hand, Qasim was happy that his name was in the register of martyrdom. On the other hand, the honorable child of Banu Hashim writhed and began to ask, 'Uncle, will the wicked enter the tents?'

**هل يسلّون إلى الخيام**
Will they reach the tents?
- [Reference needed]

So I will say, O honorable child of Banu Hashim, he could not hear that the wicked would enter the tents. Now imagine Imam Zayn al-Abidin, Sayyid Sajjad, peace be upon them, on the afternoon of Ashura, seeing the tents ablaze and the wicked advancing towards the tents. And Sayyid Sajjad, peace be upon them, is seeing the whole scene: chadors being snatched from the heads of the ladies, and lashes being inflicted.

The day of Ashura arrived, the chain of martyrdoms began until that point came when the series of martyrdoms of Banu Hashim commenced. Once the series of martyrdoms of the children of Imam Hassan, peace be upon them, began, Qasim came again and stood before Husayn. 'Uncle, please give permission. Uncle, please give permission.' Now listen to the sentence from Maqtal (narrative of martyrdom). It is written in Maqtal that Husayn is standing silently, Husayn is unable to give permission, standing silently, so once Qasim took both of Husayn's hands and began to rub them against his eyes. 'Uncle, please give permission. Uncle, please give permission.' Until Husayn said, 'Go Qasim, I have given permission.' Now Husayn prepared Qasim, adorned him, and before putting him on the horse, he embraced Qasim once. Both uncle and nephew cried so much, they cried so much that they fainted. O mourners, when someone faints, water is sprinkled to bring them back to consciousness, but alas, the helplessness of Lady Zaynab, peace be upon them. Oh, it was the time of Ashura, and there was no arrangement for water; they sprinkled tears. When somehow the uncle and nephew regained consciousness, he said, 'Brother, do not stop Qasim now, give Qasim permission.' As Husayn questioned Qasim while leaving, he once **گریباں چاک کیا** (tore his collar). Qasim said, 'Uncle, what is this?' Husayn said, 'This is a sign of orphans.' 'Qasim, go now. When you leave, I remembered my brother, that's why I tore my collar, and perhaps Husayn tore it so that the enemy might take pity on seeing an orphan.' But what happened was that as Qasim fought, he sent many wicked ones to hell. Suddenly, a wicked person struck such a blow that Qasim began to tremble. Now, when he fell from the horse, his stirrup got stuck in the horse, got stuck in the horse's saddle. Now, when Qasim got stuck like that, fell like that, the horse dragged Qasim by his hair amidst the wicked. Qasim's body was among the wicked. The oppressors began to cut Qasim's body into pieces. They repeatedly trampled Qasim's body with horses. By the time Husayn arrived, Qasim's body had been cut into pieces. It is written in Maqtal that when Husayn arrived, he spread his **ردا** (cloak). Qasim's body pieces were gathered in such a way that they formed a bundle. And that bundle was brought and placed in the tent. Then wailing and lamentation erupted: **وَاعَاسِمَا وَاحُسَیْنَا وَا مَظْلُومَا** (O Qasim! O Husayn! O Oppressed one!). Matam of Husayn.

> Among those reports is what the historians have narrated through various chains: that al-Hajjāj ibn Yūsuf al-Thaqafī said one day, "I wish to strike down a man from among the companions of Abū Turāb, so that I may seek nearness to Allah through his blood."
> It was said to him, "We do not know anyone who had longer companionship with Abū Turāb than Qanbar, his servant." So he sent someone to fetch him, and he was brought before him.
> He said to him, "Are you Qanbar?" He said, "Yes."
> He said, "Abū Hamdān?" He said, "Yes."
> He said, "The servant of Ali ibn Abi Talib?" He replied, "Allah is my Master, and Ameerul Momineen, Imam Ali (peace be upon him), is the guardian of my blessing."
> He said, "Disassociate yourself from his religion!"
> He said, "And if I do disassociate from his religion, will you guide me to a religion better than it?"
> He said, "I am going to kill you. Choose whichever manner of killing is most beloved to you."
> He said, "I have left that up to you."
> He said, "And why is that?"
> He replied, "Because you will not kill me in any manner except that I will kill you in the same way. And Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) informed me that my end would be slaughter, unjustly and without right."
> So he ordered for him to be slaughtered.
> This is also among the reports that are authentically narrated from Ameerul Momineen (peace be upon him) concerning the unseen, falling under the category of overpowering miracles, manifest proofs, and knowledge that Allah has singled out for His proofs among His Prophets, Messengers, and Trustees (peace be upon them all). It is in line with what we have previously mentioned.

> ما رددتها استقلالا و لكن سألنى الصبىّ أن أعلّمه القرآن فاختلط تعليم النحو بتعليم القرآن فلا أستحلّ أن آخذ منه شيئا و لو دفع الى الدنيا. و كان عقدة زيديا و كان ورعا ناسكا، و انما سمّى عقدة لاجل تعقيده في التصريف، و كان وراقا جيد الخط، و كان ابنه أبو العباس أحفظ من كان في عصرنا للحديث- ثم ذكر شطرا ممّا يدلّ على كثرة حديثه و حفظه و مكتبته حتّى قال: «قال الصورى: و قال لي أبو سعيد المالينى: أراد أبو العباس أن ينتقل من الموضع الذي كان فيه الى موضع آخر، فاستأجر من يحمل كتبه و شارط الحمالين أن يدفع لكل واحد منهم دانقا لكل كرة، فوزن لهم اجورهم مائة درهم و كانت كتبه ستمائة حمل. و بالجملة ولد ابن عقدة سنة 249 و مات 332. راجع تاريخ الخطيب ج 5 ص 22 و 23.

> From him, from al-Husain ibn Muhammad ibn Jumhoor, from Muhammad ibn Ali, from Ali ibn al-Hasan, from Ali ibn Muhammad, from Asim al-Khayyat, from Abu Hamzah al-Thumali, who said:
> I heard Ali ibn al-Husain (peace be upon them both) say: When it was the day on which Abu Abdillah, Imam al-Husain (peace be upon him), was martyred, he gathered his family and companions on the night of that day and said to them: "O my family and my Shia, take this night as a camel and escape with yourselves, for I am the only one sought, and if they kill me, they will not think of you. So save yourselves, may Allah have mercy on you. You are in release and freedom from my allegiance and from the covenant of Allah that you made with me."
> His brothers, family, and supporters all said with one voice: "By Allah, O our master Abu Abdillah, we will never leave you. What would people say—that they abandoned their Imam, their master, and their elder until he was killed? May we never offer such an excuse before Allah, and far be it from Allah that this should ever happen, or that we be killed except with you."
> Then he (peace be upon him) said: "O my people, indeed tomorrow I will be killed, and you all will be killed, such that none of you will remain."
> They said: "Praise be to Allah who honored us with your support and granted us the dignity of being killed with you. Are you not pleased that we be with you in your rank, O son of the daughter of the Messenger of Allah?"
> So he said good things to them and prayed for them with goodness. Then the morning came, and he was killed, and they were all killed with him.
> Then al-Qasim, the son of my brother al-Hasan, said to him: "O uncle, will I be killed too?" He felt compassion for him, then said: "O son of my brother, how do you find death?" He said: "O uncle, it is sweeter than honey." He said: "Yes, by Allah, it is even sweeter. None of the men who are with me will be killed without undergoing a great trial. And my son Abdullah, when he fears thirst—"
> He said: "O uncle, will they even reach the women, until Abdullah is killed while still an infant?"
> He replied: "May your uncle be sacrificed for you, Abdullah will be killed when he fears thirst. My soul will go, and I will return to our tents. I will search for what we had given him, and I will not find it. So I will say: 'Hand me Abdullah to drink from his mouth, for that would soothe my suffering.' Then they will give him to me, and I will carry him in my hands. I will bring his mouth close to mine, and then one of those people—may Allah curse him—will shoot him with an arrow, and it will kill him while he is still babbling. His blood will pour into my palms, and I will raise them to the sky and say: 'O Allah, in patience and seeking reward from You.'"
> "Then the spears of those people will reach me, and the fire will burn and rage in the trench behind the tents. So I will charge at them in the last moments of my stay in this worldly abode, and what Allah wills shall be."
> He cried, and we cried, and the crying and wailing of the descendants of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him and his holy progeny) rose in the tents. Zuhayr ibn al-Qayn and Habib ibn Muzahir asked me about Ali, saying: "O our master Ali, what will be his fate?"
> So I said, tearfully: "Allah would never cut off my progeny from this world. How could they reach him, when he is the father of eight Imams?" And everything he said would come to pass, and this was among his signs (peace be upon him).
