Now, our master and leader Hussain ibn Ali, peace be upon them, said:
`"ولوصبرتم على الأذى وتحملتم المؤونة في ذات الله لكانت امور الله عليكم ترد وعنكم تصدر وإليكم ترجع"`
(And if you were patient in the face of harm and endured hardship for the sake of Allah, then the affairs of Allah would come to you, originate from you, and return to you).
Our master and leader Hussain ibn Ali, peace be upon them, has spoken the truth.
Blessings.
`اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد وعجل فرجهم والعن اعدائهم`
(O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their relief, and curse their enemies).

### Introduction to the Hadith of Imam Hussain (A.S.)

I have chosen this noble hadith for this Ashura, for these five gatherings. In this noble hadith, the Imam says: `"ولو صبرتم على الأذى"` (And if you were patient in the face of harm) – "if you were patient in the face of harm, meaning in the face of difficulties, in the face of calamities." `"وتحملتم المؤونة في ذات الله"` (And if you endured hardship for the sake of Allah) – "and if for the sake of Allah you persevered, with fortitude, you endured, then" `"كانت امور الله عليكم ترد"` (the affairs of Allah would come to you) – "and peace be upon you. So the affairs of Allah would come upon you."

#### Interpretation of Imam Hussain's (A.S.) Hadith

`"امور الله عليكم ترد"` (The affairs of Allah would come to you) – "The affairs of Allah would come upon you." `"وعنكم تصدر"` (and originate from you) – "Not only would they come upon you, but the affairs of Allah would originate from you. Allah would cause His affairs to originate through you, they would emanate, come forth through you. That means you would be the source of Allah, the source of Allah's affairs. This is a very great matter, not a small one. If you reflect on this a little, you become the source of Allah's affairs. Not only do Allah's affairs come upon you, but you become the source of Allah's affairs. Allah would cause His affairs to originate through you." `"وإليكم ترجع"` (and return to you) – "and Allah's affairs would return to you, come back to you. That means Allah would ensure that His affairs, which came from Him, and which originated from you, would return to you. That means you would become the owner of those perfections, those things, those perfections that Allah has created in this world, and through which Allah carries out His work, you would become its focus. Allah would make you the focus of His dealings. That means you would become an axis, a point for Allah."

#### The Conditions for Divine Affairs: Patience and Endurance

But for this, two conditions were necessary, which the Imam stated. One is patience and the second is endurance. I explained both to you yesterday in the commentary, not a full commentary but briefly yesterday, what patience and endurance mean. When a person is patient and endures, there are different aspects to it and how different things, which are presented to you, should not be repeated because time is short anyway. Now after this, the Master says, but what happened? He is saying, you neither exercised patience nor endurance. What strange sentences the Master is saying, that if you did this, all these things would happen. In other words, if we put it in one sentence, you did not recognize your own worth. You completely degraded yourself. You brought yourself to a very low level. You did not understand what you are.

### The Importance of Recognizing One's Worth (`Ma'rifat al-Qadr`)

#### Commander of the Faithful (A.S.) on Knowing One's Worth

That is why the Master says, Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon them, says in a hadith: `"رحم الله من يعرف قدره ولم يتعد حده"` (May Allah have mercy on the servant who knows his worth and does not transgress his limits) or `"ولم يتجاوز حده"` (does not exceed his boundaries) – "that Allah's mercy be upon that servant who knows his worth, who knows his value. His own value, that is why many times in hadith the Imams, peace be upon them, have said to their Shia, O Shia! Know your worth."

#### The Narration of Abu Basir in Rawdat al-Kafi

And that is why the famous hadith of Abu Basir, when he came in old age and breathed heavily, this is a famous hadith from `روضۃ الکافی` (Rawdat al-Kafi), the last volume of Kafi, the eighth volume, it's a hadith from there. Approximately on page number 63. Abu Basir had become very old, he was a very great companion. Abu Basir was such a great companion that the Imam says that if Abu Basir and three other names the Imam took, if these four individuals were not there, then `لندرست آثار الوحي` (the signs of revelation would have been obliterated) or `آثار النبوة` (the signs of prophethood). That means the signs of revelation and prophethood would have been erased. If these four companions of Imam Sadiq, peace be upon them, were not there. They worked so hard, so hard, meaning what did they work on? On hadith, narrations, tafsir, fiqh. They did so much work! Abu Basir spent his entire life in this, just imagine, this man spent his entire life in the field of hadith, now he is blind, his eyesight is gone, he is very old, now he came to the service of Imam Sadiq, peace be upon them, and today he can barely walk, breathing heavily, so the Imam asked Abu Basir what is the reason for this heavy breathing? What is the reason for this heavy breathing? Why are you breathing so heavily? So he said: `"یا مولا!"` (O Master!) peace be upon him, `"كبر سني"` (my age has grown) I have also grown old, `"ودق عظمي"` (and my bones have become weak). Meaning now I am not fit for anything. But I don't know what my fate will be in the afterlife. Will it be felicity, wretchedness, what will be the outcome, I don't know. Well, we do a little work and think that Salman Farsi is nothing compared to us. We do a little work. And Abu Basir, after spending his whole life, says I don't know what my fate will be. So the Imam immediately turned and said, Abu Basir, a person like you talks like this? A person like you? So then what can others say when you think like this? So he said, Master, what should I say then? I don't understand what my deeds, what my fate will be? Then the Imam discussed his belief and then the entire hadith is very long, the Imam said that these Imams recited one verse after another, Abu Basir, this verse is in praise of our Shia. And after each hadith, after explaining its interpretation, the Imam says: `"هل سررتك"` (Have I made you happy?) `"يا أبا محمد"` (O Abu Muhammad)? Have you become happy or not? O Abu Muhammad. Abu Muhammad was Abu Basir's kunya. Actually, his kunya was Abu Muhammad, not Abu Basir. He was called Abu Basir because he became blind, so the Imam, peace be upon them, out of respect, called him Abu Basir. Out of respect, he was called Abu Basir, otherwise, his actual kunya is Abu Muhammad. So after every verse, the Imam would ask, meaning after reciting the verse, the Imam would say that this verse was revealed in your praise. And he would say: `"هل سررتك يا أبا محمد"` (Have I made you happy, O Abu Muhammad)? Are you happy now or not? But Abu Basir was not one to be happy so easily. Every time he would say, add a little more, explain a little more, so the Imam would recite more verses and explain the interpretation, this is also for you. All the verses of virtue in the Quran, the Imam said all of them are for our Shia.

#### The Virtue and Status of the Shia

So Shia should know their worth. But Shia have degraded themselves so much, so much. To an unimaginable extent. Everywhere, look, not just here and there, everywhere, everywhere it is like this. Shia have degraded themselves from their level, their status. That is, there are so many examples that cannot be explained here in such a short time, but I will just say one sentence to you, that if only Shia knew their worth, today Shia would rule the world. But they did not know their worth. They completely degraded themselves. There is no exception in this, first and foremost, the same conditions are everywhere, what can we tell you. I mean, we don't need to give examples right now. But people don't know what we are. We are lovers of the Ahlul Bayt (People of the Household of the Prophet). What is our status, what is our position. If you only study the narrations.

#### Sheikh Sadooq's Books: Qualities and Virtues of the Shia

Even Sheikh Sadooq, when he wrote a book. Sheikh Sadooq wrote a book `صفات الشيعة` (Qualities of the Shia), `فضائل الشيعة` (Virtues of the Shia). What are the virtues of the Shia? In this book, Sheikh Sadooq wrote about the stations. So people said that if you, I mean, if people read this book, they will abandon good deeds. So write another book. So he wrote `صفات الشيعة` (Qualities of the Shia) after `فضائل الشيعة` (Virtues of the Shia). That is, to be a Shia, one must have these qualities, only then can he be called a Shia. Otherwise, he cannot be called a Shia. He had to write this book. This is very important. Insha'Allah, if Allah grants success, we will present it to you.

### The Consequences of Enabling Oppressors (`Dhulm`)

But look, now listen to the words of the Master of Martyrs, leave our words. Leave our sentences. The Master of Martyrs says: `"ولكن"` (But) – what we were telling you, listen to what the Master of Martyrs says. He says: `"ولكنكم مكنتم الظلمة من منزلتكم"` (But you enabled the oppressors to take your position) – "You degraded yourself from your status and seated the oppressors in your place. You brought yourself down, you degraded yourself. And you gave power to the oppressors. `مكنتم` (Makantum) in Arabic means to make powerful. Tamkeen means to make it powerful, to give it power. You gave it power, and brought yourself completely down. `"مكنتم ولكنكم مكنتم الظلمة من منزلتكم"` (But you enabled the oppressors to take your position) – "That is, you seated the oppressors in your position, and you came down."

#### Enabling Oppressors to Usurp Position

Now because the statement is exactly this sentence, so now we will give this example, although we did not want to, but now we will tell you. We were invited to a program once, about three or four years ago, I think four years. There was a program, and they said, 'Brother, it is very important for you to come.' We said, 'Okay,' they insisted a lot, so we went, because usually we don't go out much, we try not to go. They insisted a lot, so we went. Now when we went there, we saw a strange sight. We saw a big chair placed there. And then below it, small chairs were placed, a sofa was placed, and some chairs on both sides. That big chair was also placed a little high. And this sofa was placed below. The organizers were Shia. Now they seated Shia scholars below, and above them they seated a Sunni scholar, whom we call 'buckri' (goat), that Umari scholar was seated above and the Shia were seated below. As soon as we saw it, we lost control, we called the organizer, 'Come here!' We said, 'What is this disrespect?' We were speaking loudly to him, he said, 'What happened, sir?' We said, 'Are you insulting Shia scholars? You keep them below and this one above!' 'Oh, he is very influential, the Chief Minister knows him.' And see how they are degrading, how they are degrading Shia. The Chief Minister knows him, the Commissioner knows him, so and so. Let's move a little in this direction, a little bit, recite a Salawat. `اللهم صل على محمد وآل محمد وعجل فرجهم` (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their relief). The point is, how, I mean, how low was that act. Simply because that buckri's acquaintance was with the Chief Minister. Who is the Chief Minister? What is his position? What is the Commissioner? What is his position? He is here today, gone tomorrow, he has no standing. And you are seating Shia scholars below? I mean, we told them right there, we said, 'This is an insult to Shia. This is an insult to Shiism, Shia scholars are sitting below and this buckri is sitting above.' And we know that buckri personally, he is completely ignorant, absolutely ignorant, I mean, you understand what the word 'ignorant' means, ignorant. I mean, purely ignorant, meaning ignorance personified. I mean, generally all buckri are ignorant, but he is somewhat more ignorant. But because he is like a politician, he has good political influence, so they seated him above. We are just giving you an example. So anyway, here the Imam says, you gave to the oppressors.

#### The Depth of the Imams' Words: Outer and Inner Meanings

Now look, let me tell you something else, the words of the Imams, peace be upon them, are very profound, very deep. Just like a verse of the Quran, what does the hadith say about the Quran: `"إن للقرآن ظهرا وبطنا، ولبطنه بطنا إلى سبعة أبطن"` (Indeed, the Quran has an outer meaning and an inner meaning, and its inner meaning has an inner meaning up to seven inner meanings). The Quran has an outer meaning, an inner meaning, and every inner meaning, meaning hidden meaning. And for every hidden meaning, there are other hidden meanings, and so on, you can go 70 times deeper. 70 times, this is a hadith. In another hadith, the Imam says that our hadiths are also like the Quran. Our hadiths are also like the Quran, in that they have an outer meaning, an inner meaning, firm verses, and allegorical verses. Just as the Quranic verses are, so are our hadiths. And there are many narrations in this regard: `"لا يُعد الرجل فقيهًا حتى يعرف معاني كلامنا"` (A man is not considered a jurist until he knows the meanings of our words). And then the Imam says, for each of our hadiths, there are at least 70 interpretations. Interpretations, meaning its explanations. There are at least 70 interpretations. And whenever we wish, we can go beyond any interpretation. So that's why if one word came in a hadith, 'you seated the oppressors in your place and you came down.'

#### Understanding the Concept of `Zaalim` (Oppressor) in the Quran

If we only discuss the word `ظالم` (Zaalim) (oppressor), then it requires a lot of discussion, but we will present a few hadiths to you, so that you know what the concept of an oppressor is. Look, first of all, the word `ظالم` (Zaalim) (oppressor) has appeared many times in the Quran, many times. And in different meanings, different interpretations have come, but we will just present two verses to you. One is a verse from Surah Luqman and one is a verse from Surah Ahzab.

##### Polytheism (`Shirk`) as the Greatest Oppression

What is the verse from Surah Luqman: `"وإذ قال لقمان لابنه وهو يعظه: يا بني لا تشرك بالله إن الشرك لظلم عظيم"` (And when Luqman said to his son while he was advising him, 'O my son, do not associate partners with Allah. Indeed, polytheism is a great injustice').
- [Reference needed]
Luqman said to his son, 'O my son, never associate anyone with Allah, because polytheism is the greatest injustice.' There is no greater injustice than polytheism. This is one verse, keep it in mind, Insha'Allah we will come back to it if Allah grants success.

##### The Trust (`Amanah`) and the Oppressive Ignorant Human

The second verse is Surah Ahzab, verse number 72. In it, 72. Surah Ahzab has a total of 73 verses, this is the 72nd verse. In it, Allah says: `"إنا عرضنا الأمانة على السماوات والأرض والجبال فأبين أن يحملنها وأشفقن منها"` (Indeed, We offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to bear it and feared it).
- [Reference needed]
We presented the Trust to the heavens, to the earth, to the mountains, but the heavens and the earths and the mountains refused to bear this Trust, and they were afraid upon seeing it, what is the Quranic word, they were afraid upon seeing it. The Trust, meaning it was such a great thing that they were afraid upon seeing it. Who was afraid? The heavens, the earth, the mountains. Whereas what does the Quran say about the heavens: `"لخلق السماوات أكبر من خلق الناس"` (Indeed, the creation of the heavens is greater than the creation of mankind).
- [Reference needed]
That is, the creation of the heavens is much greater than the creation of man. That is, the creation of man is nothing. The creation of man is nothing compared to the heavens. Absolutely nothing. I mean, the number of angels in the heavens is more than the particles of the earth, the number of particles in the earth is less than the number of angels in the heavens. Now you understand. And then the definition, the description given for each angel in hadith is a separate discussion. But here Allah is saying that when we presented Wilayat to the heaven and earth and mountains, they refused to bear it, they were afraid upon seeing it, Wilayat (Guardianship) is a strange thing. They were afraid upon seeing Wilayat, `"وحملها الإنسان"` (but man bore it) – but man bore this Wilayat.
- [Reference needed]
Who is this man who bore Wilayat? The Quran says about him: `"إنه كان ظلوما جهولا"` (Indeed, he was ever unjust and ignorant).
- [Reference needed]
This was a very great oppressor and ignorant man who bore Wilayat. He neither understood this Wilayat nor was he afraid of this Wilayat. He did not even understand that he was not eligible for it. This is such a great thing, such a magnificent thing that I am not even eligible for it. But he sat on the chair of caliphate. And he thought that now I have become Khalifatullah, Khalifat Rasulullah. He became the Caliph of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. He did not understand where he had sat? Whose position was this, whose status was this? The Quran called him an oppressor, and `"ظلوم"` (Zalum) in the Quran when they say 'zaloom' means in Arabic, a hyperbole. It means a lot, to show exaggeration. Allah is exaggerating in this. Zalum! A very great oppressor! And `"جہول"` (Jahool) meaning a very great ignorant person. Who was this? The Imam says Abu Bakr. The Imam says it was him. In the narration, different codes are used, he is called Abul Fasir. Yes. So this should actually be known, the codes too. So that a person thinks before his pen name. Right? His kunya was Abul Fasir. Right? And Umar's code was 'Roma'. The Imam would say 'Roma' by reversing it, 'Roma', he says this is 'Roma', Abul Fasir, there are many different names, they will be explained later. But who is the oppressor? The greatest oppressor is he who sat on the chair of the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them, who usurped the right of the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them, there is no greater oppressor than him.

##### Lying About Allah and Denying the Truth

And similarly, there are other verses of the Quran: `"فمن أظلم ممن كذب على الله وكذب بالصدق إذ جاءه"` (And who is more unjust than one who lies about Allah and denies the truth when it comes to him).
- [Reference needed]
And who is a greater oppressor? Who attributes lies to Allah. And when the truth comes to him, he denies it. And similarly, another verse was from Surah Zummar, in Surah Ankabut it says: `"ومن أظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا"` (And who is more unjust than one who fabricates a lie about Allah) `"وكذب بالحق إذ جاء"` (and denies the truth when it comes).
- [Reference needed]
Who is he who attributes lies to Allah? And denies the truth when the truth comes to him.

##### Imam Ali (A.S.) as the Embodiment of Truth

Who is the truth? `"علی مع الحق والحق مع علی"` (Ali is with the truth and the truth is with Ali).
- [Reference needed]
`"اللهم أدر الحق حيث دار"` (O Allah, turn the truth wherever Ali turns).
- [Reference needed]
The truth is with Ali, Ali is with the truth, O Lord, wherever Ali turns, turn the truth there. Wherever Ali turns, it is not said, 'look where Ali is, there is the truth.' No, wherever Ali is, there will be the truth. The truth will follow him, if Ali turns this way, then this way, if he turns that way, then that way, wherever Ali is, there will be the truth. But it's very easy, and that's why it's very important that we always, in everything, this should be our culture, that in everything we ask what is truth, what is falsehood? What is right, what is wrong? That's why it's very important to ask the right questions. To ask the right questions, but always, in every matter, never act with fanaticism. One should ask the right questions. And when you ask the right questions, you will know what is truth and what is falsehood. You will know immediately. Look, it's the same in court. In court, lawyers do both sides, right? Lawyers do both sides. But who is the great lawyer? The one who asks the right questions, and who asks good questions, right questions, the opponent has no answer. So that's why this oppression is a very big thing, a very big sin, the Quran has condemned it so much, that when a person does not support the truth. That's why you see there are many narrations about this. We will not present more than two or three to you, just two or three.

#### Categories of Oppressors and the Gravity of Their Sin

Now before proceeding, let me tell you something else. That is, when we understand oppression, it means he who usurped the right of the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them, certainly. He who associated partners with Allah, he is the greatest oppressor. Secondly, he who usurped the right of the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them. Thirdly, he who supported those usurpers. Fourthly, he who inclined towards the usurpers. Fifthly, he who had even a little love for the usurpers in his heart, that's why the Imam says, if anyone has even an atom's weight of love for these two in his heart, Allah will throw him into hell headfirst. Even if it's a little bit.

#### Refuting Misconceptions about Others' Salvation

But nowadays, we have a new concept among Shia, they bring a hadith from Bihar al-Anwar and say that Sunnis will also enter paradise through the eighth gate. They bring a hadith from Bihar al-Anwar, it is mentioned there. First, understand what the hadith says. And this has become very important, first of all, it comes from the main place and then it is spread all over the world, they will also enter paradise. So if they are the ones who are going to enter paradise, then why are we toiling, brother? Then we should become like them. We are being killed, we are being murdered, everything is happening, and the accusation against us is precisely this, that these are infidels because they speak ill of the companions and those are Sunnis because they respect the companions. So if the issue is the same, then it is better we go that way. If the eighth gate, the goal is the same, isn't it? To go to paradise. Isn't it? So why don't we go somehow, and what else? The problem will be solved, right? Then why do we put so much effort, hardship, and get beaten up all over the world and practice taqiyya and all other things. Look, that hadith is not that. That hadith is about those who will go through the eighth gate. You tell the words of the rest of the hadith, the rest of the Muslims will go, those who love the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them. Those who do not bear hatred for the Ahlul Bayt, peace be upon them. They will go. What is the meaning of this hadith? When you place it in comparison with another hadith that those in whose hearts there is love for the usurpers, it is explicitly written, clearly written, that they will go to hell. Rather, they have been cursed in duas. They have been cursed. Very explicitly, even those who incline towards them, not just incline, but who doubt the disbelief of the usurpers. They have been cursed. Look, I will give you the reference of the dua too. Mahaj al-Da'awat, Sayyid ibn Tawus's book, a very famous dua that is a reference in Mafatih al-Jinan. And Mustadrak Wasail al-Muhaddith Nuri, volume five, page number 60, this dua is mentioned. And the dua begins with Imam Sajjad, peace be upon them, saying that he is not our Shia. `اللهم صل علی محمد و آل محمد و عجل فرجہم و لعن اعدائہم اجمعین` (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their relief, and curse all their enemies). Meaning he has not fulfilled our right as our Shia until he recites this dua and does not leave his prayer mat. Does not leave the prayer mat, it is a small dua. It does not even take two minutes, two minutes. It only takes two minutes to recite the dua. Even less than two minutes if it comes to tongue, even less than two minutes. If you are 30, 30 seconds, 45 seconds, that's it. Or a maximum of one minute, no more than that. Its last sentences are these: `اللهم لعنہما و اغضبتہما` (O Allah, curse them both and make them angry) O Lord, curse both of them. Curse their two daughters, like that. And then, `و من شک فی کفرہم` (And whoever doubts their disbelief). Curse him too. Meaning, people of paradise are being cursed. People of paradise are being cursed. `من مال الیہم` (Whoever inclines towards them). Even a little inclination. Talk to any Sunni, he will not incline. So creating such a hadith and sending all others to paradise is an insult to all Shia. You understand, right? I mean, the point is not understood, but anyway, look, what is truth will be truth, Insha'Allah, recite this Salawat. `اللهم صل علی محمد و آل محمد و عجل فرجہم و لعن اعدائہم` (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and hasten their relief, and curse their enemies).

### Self-Accountability: Oppression in Our Own Lives

Now we condemn oppression, the one who usurped Commander of the Faithful's right, whoever inclined towards them in this way. But we should also see whether we ourselves are oppressing others in our own lives or not. We should also look at this. For example, oppressing our parents, are we observing their rights or not? For example, oppressing our brothers and sisters, for example, oppressing our children, oppressing our wives and children, are we observing their rights or not, because all these are also oppressions.

#### The Insidious Nature of Small Oppression

And that is why it is in the hadiths that never consider any oppression as small. Because when does this oppression, this oppression is like fire, like a small spark. There is a spark, what does a spark do? It sets the whole jungle on fire. It is a small spark but it can set the whole jungle on fire. This oppression is like that. When a person starts oppressing and justifies it, meaning he justifies it. No, no, this was necessary, no, this should have happened, no, you don't understand my position. I had to do it. Then what happens is there is no limit to it. Then it keeps increasing, you pick up the newspaper daily and you will find sins. All kinds of sins, how many sins are happening today. You see, right? Just read the newspaper, see what is happening in the world. The reason for this is that when a person started, he started with a small sin. And then that sin increased and there is no limit to that sin. Why? Because Satan is his whisperer, he does not have any. That's why in narrations it is strictly forbidden whenever you see, let me read two or three hadiths and then explain the matter. Pay close attention to this.

#### Consequences of Oppression in This World and the Hereafter

The Imam says: `«الظلم فی الدنیا بوار و فی الاخرۃ دمار»` (Oppression in this world leads to ruin and in the afterlife to destruction) meaning oppression in this world becomes a cause of ruin.
- [Reference needed]
`بوار` (Bawar) means ruin, ruin means devastation. Meaning life gets ruined, destroyed. When a person, there is an Arabic proverb too. `«الملک یبقی مع الظلم»` (Kingship remains with injustice) `«الملک یبقی مع الکفر ولا یبقی مع الظلم»` (Kingship can remain with disbelief but not with injustice).
- [Reference needed]
It never remains. The Master is saying the same thing that `«الظلم فی الدنیا بوار»` (Oppression in this world is ruin) that the Master's saying is, not our words. This world, what is oppression in this world? It is `بوار` (Bawar) meaning it becomes a cause of ruin. `«وفی الآخرۃ دمار»` (And in the afterlife, destruction). And his afterlife is completely ruined. It's over. If we discuss the rights of people, Insha'Allah we will discuss it. Even if it's a little bit, one should be very careful.

#### Oppression and the Bridge of Sirat

`«الظلم یذلل القدم»` (Oppression causes the foot to slip) meaning due to oppression, feet will slip.

Where will they slip? On the Bridge of Sirat. People will not be able to cross the Bridge of Sirat, will not be able to cross it. `«یذلل القدم»` (It makes the foot slip) slipping. Slipping. `«یذلل القدم»` (It makes the foot slip) Is the Bridge of Sirat easy? The Bridge of Sirat is easy. What is written in the narration? That `«احد من السیف وادق من الشعر»` (sharper than a sword and thinner than a hair).
- [Reference needed]
The Bridge of Sirat is very difficult. It's not easy. It's difficult for everyone.

#### Oppression's Impact on Blessings and Nations

And after that, he says that `«یھلک الاوام و یسلب النعم»` (it destroys nations and snatches away blessings).
- [Reference needed]
What happens due to oppression? Blessings are taken away. Allah snatches away blessings. And nations are destroyed by it, entire nations are ruined. Not just individuals, entire nations are ruined. What is happening with the entire Muslim Ummah today. You see it all over the world, don't you? This is happening only because of this. They committed oppression and felt not an ounce of shame. This is a very good young poet, Abbas Salawi. He has a couplet whose meaning I will convey to you because I am not from the field of poetry but I just remember the meaning. His couplet is very good that if the voice of the Ummah had risen for the martyrdom of Hadrat Mohsin, peace be upon him, then today there would be no bombing in Gaza. Children would not be killed in Gaza. If a voice had risen for the martyrdom of Hadrat Mohsin, peace be upon him. But the entire Muslim Ummah was silent on Hadrat Mohsin, peace be upon him. No one uttered a single word. Not a single word. That is why the Princess explicitly said in the court, 'You will remain disgraced and humiliated until Qiyamah.' Disgrace and humiliation are your destiny, that is why oppression is such a bad thing.

#### The Importance of Fulfilling Rights of All Servants of Allah

Now the next point we are coming to is this, who will be stopped on the Bridge of Sirat? Those who oppressed in the rights of people. Remember, oppression in the rights of people means whether he is a Muslim or a non-Muslim, it doesn't matter. Even if he is a non-Muslim. If any injustice has been done to him. Then returning his usurped right is obligatory on us. Returning usurped rights is obligatory on us. Is it clear? Regarding the rights of people, meaning what is the phrase in this hadith? `«من ظلم عباد اللہ»` (Whoever oppresses the servants of Allah) here it does not say believers in the hadith. Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon them, says `«من ظلم عباد اللہ»` (Whoever oppresses the servants of Allah), `"قال اللہ خصم دور عبادہ"` (Allah will file a case against him, beyond his servants).
- [Reference needed]
Servants will do it later, first Allah will file a case against him. Allah will be his adversary. Why did you oppress My such and such servant? No argument will work in this. The meaning of oppression should be clear. His right, his actual right.

#### Commander of the Faithful (A.S.) on Not Usurping Even an Ant's Right

That is why the Commander of the Faithful says a strange sentence in Nahj al-Balagha. Look at the sentence. He says `«واللہ»` (By Allah) by Allah, the Commander of the Faithful could just say it and it would be sufficient, but he says, 'By Allah', `«واللہ لو اتیتو»` (By Allah, if I am given) if I am given `«الاقالیم السبعہ»` (the seven regions) seven worlds, seven universes, if I am given them. Right? `«بما تحت افلاکها»` (with what is under their skies) along with all the planets under each universe. Along with all the worlds. If everything is given, just for what? `«علی ان اعصیہا»` (on the condition that I disobey Him) that I disobey Allah, I disobey Allah. For what? Listen. It's a sentence by Commander of the Faithful. I disobey Allah for what? That `«فی نملتین»` (in two ants) regarding one ant. Regarding one ant `اسلبہ جل و شعیرۃ ما فعلتو` (if I snatch a grain of wheat from it, I would not do it).
- [Reference needed]
That the grain of wheat that is in the mouth of that ant. If I snatch it. While doing injustice, I snatch that grain and in return I am given seven universes, I will not take those seven universes for one grain of wheat. Allahu Akbar, look what the Commander of the Faithful is saying. Look, what is this oppression? How easily we usurp someone's right. Before the inauguration of a mosque, the founder of the mosque took us. He invited us saying, 'Brother Shabib, the inauguration is tomorrow, please come today, I will show you.' So we went, thinking, 'Okay, he is a sincere person.' And anyway, one has to build relations with everyone, right? So we went. Now when we went, he showed us, 'Look, this is the mosque.' We said, 'Masha'Allah, very good, Masha'Allah, we praised it, Masha'Allah, very good.' Then after that, further inside, further inside, 'Look, this part, didn't the neighbors usurp it?' What he said, we are telling you. Not our words. His words. 'They usurped it, didn't they?' Usurped what? We said, 'He was a Sunni.' 'They usurped it.' We said, 'It's not permissible.' 'It's not permissible.' 'Oh, he is a Sunni.' We said, 'Not Sunni.' We said, 'If he is a Hindu, it's also not permissible.' If he is a non-Muslim, it's also not permissible. You are usurping and coming to the mosque and leading prayers for someone. 'Oh, Brother Shabib, don't think so much about this. Look. If you think too much, it causes a lot of problems.' We said, 'Brother, it was our job to speak. Whether you act upon it or not is your job, wherever the worshipers pray, that's their headache. Our's is not, we have spoken, it's over.' Now it's your responsibility. Now think, they are doing this for the house of Allah. What intention they have, Allah knows best. But even a tiny bit, a particle of it, so the Master says `«ما فعلتہ»` (I would not do it). So that's why the Master says, let's go back to the hadith of Imam Hussain, peace be upon them, and conclude here, he says `«اسلمتم امور اللہ فی ایدیہم»` (you handed over the affairs of Allah to them) those affairs of Allah that were to come upon you, originate from you, and return to you, now you have handed over those affairs to those oppressors. You handed everything over to them.

### Historical Ramifications of Handing Over Affairs to Oppressors

Now what will they do, Insha'Allah in tomorrow's gathering if there is life and success, then in tomorrow's gathering, but what will they do, now that's what happened, look what happened in Islam.

#### The Succession of Caliphs and Their Actions

One caliph after another kept coming. The first one was there for four years, the second one thought that he would not die soon, so kill him. So the second one conspired against the first one and killed him. These are all historical facts we are telling you, no stories. Meaning, Umar killed Abu Bakr, Abu Bakr did not die a natural death. Right? Then after that, you know about Umar, Abul Lulu, may Allah have mercy on him, nowadays Shia people are also pitying him. He is truly oppressed. That happened, then after that when Uthman came, the Umayyad rule came.

#### Uthman's Policies and the Return of Cursed Individuals

Now when the Umayyad rule came, you understand that there was no end to oppression and tyranny. What did he do? All those individuals whom the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, had cursed, he brought them all back to Medina and gave them all high posts. This is all politics, understand this. It is very important to understand all this politics. A believer is one who is shrewd. A believer is not foolish or idiotic. A believer should be clever. Is that clear? Understand politics, we are not saying play politics. The Commander of the Faithful says that if it were not for the fear of Allah, the son of Abu Talib would tell Muawiyah what politics is. If it were not for the fear of Allah. So a believer understands politics, he doesn't play politics. A hypocrite plays politics. You understand. So after the Commander of the Faithful, what happened after that? This Umayyad, what did he do? Uthman brought back all the people whom the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, had cursed, one by one, the most vile. Abdullah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh, Mughira ibn Shu'ba, one after another, if we tell you the character of each one, you will be astonished. How vile these individuals were. Just imagine, the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, said about Abdullah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Sarh that even if he holds the curtain of the Kaaba, his killing is obligatory. His killing is obligatory even then. That's why he fled Medina during the time of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family. When Uthman became governor, he came back. Now when he came back, Uthman not only kept him, but also gave him a very high position. And there are many such examples. We don't need to go into detail about many of them right now.

#### The Killing of Uthman and His Burial

After that, Uthman was killed. You know who killed him? Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfah al-Khuzai and his companions killed him very badly. That's why they say, 'You mourned for Hussain, but not for Uthman?' Oh brother, whom are you comparing with whom? Tomorrow you will say, 'Benjamin Netanyahu died, mourn for him too.' Is that clear? Is the matter done? Now his body lay for three days. The Commander of the Faithful did not allow anyone to lift his body. For three days. Uthman's body lay for three days. The Commander of the Faithful did not allow anyone to lift his body. Then the Umayyads came, they quarreled. They said, 'He is our man, we need to lift his body.' So the Master said, 'Okay, lift him, but there's a condition. Don't bury him in the Muslim cemetery.' In the Jewish cemetery. This shows what his belief was. Not in the Muslim cemetery, Jannatul Baqi. But in Hash Kawkab. Hash Kawkab is a Jewish cemetery there. Is that clear? He said, 'Bury him there.'

#### Muawiyah's Rise to Power and the Pledge to Yazid

Then after Uthman, you know what happened. Then Muawiyah came. Then Muawiyah, meaning after Uthman, Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon them, was until 40 Hijri. After 40, Muawiyah came through deception and cunning, meaning all those, what do you call them, conspiracies, and after that, until 60 Hijri, until 60 Hijri, Muawiyah remained the caliph of the Muslims. Now when 60 Hijri came, when Muawiyah was about to leave this world, before that he prepared the whole ground. He went to Mecca, Medina, everywhere, it's all written in the hadiths, in history, very explicitly, we are not reading history right now. We are just briefly telling you. He went everywhere, gathered everyone. When he reached Medina, people went to receive him, 5-6 individuals came. And before them, he said, 'Brother, look, I have come to meet you, I am the Amir of the Muslims,' and so on, and after that he said, 'Understand why I have come.' He said, 'Why have I come?' He said, 'Pledge allegiance to Yazid after me.' So these 5-6 individuals who had come, all said, 'Are you mad? What are you talking about?' All refused. Muawiyah went to the pulpit. The crowd was gathered. The Commander of the Faithful has come. And he delivered a sermon: 'O Muslims! I have come here, and here in Mecca and Medina, all the prominent companions have pledged allegiance to Yazid. Now you also pledge allegiance to Yazid by my hands.' People came and pledged allegiance to him, saying, 'Now we pledge allegiance to Yazid.' And later when they went to those individuals, 'Did you pledge allegiance to Yazid?' They said, 'We did not.' He said, 'Muawiyah lied.' All this happened in history. And all this is not in Shia books, everything we are reading is from the books of Ahl as-Sunnah. All from their books. All of it, he was lying. Lying. Yes. He was the maternal uncle. `خال المومنین` (Maternal uncle of the believers). So it's okay, he was lying. Okay.

#### Imam Hussain's (A.S.) Confrontation in Medina

Now Muawiyah was about to die. Now in Medina, at night, a message came to the Master of Martyrs, peace be upon him. That at this moment, right now, come to the court. Now here two different narrations are destined. One narration says that the Master of Martyrs was at home. The other narration says that he was in the mosque. But anyway, in the second narration, it is also that after the mosque, he went home. After going home, he told Lady Zainab, peace be upon them, 'Sister Zainab, I have been summoned to the court.' So Lady Zainab, peace be upon them, was worried, 'At such a late hour, no court is set up at night. Why were you summoned at night?' Imam Hussain, peace be upon them, said, 'I know why I have been summoned, and I also know what my answer will be.' Lady Zainab, peace be upon them, was afraid and worried, she said, 'Brother, I will not let you go alone.' She turned and said, 'Brother Abbas, peace be upon them, son Ali Akbar, peace be upon them, go, all of you together with the Master. The Master is going to the court.' 30 young men of Bani Hashim surrounded Imam Hussain, peace be upon them, and advanced towards Dar al-Imara. Now as soon as they reached near Dar al-Imara, Imam Hussain, peace be upon them, stopped them and said, 'You all stand outside, I will go inside alone, but as soon as my voice is raised, do not wait, just come inside immediately.' Hussain, peace be upon him, came and sat down. After sitting down, he was informed that Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, the Amir of the Muslims, had died. The Imam, peace be upon him, according to Islamic rules, recited the verse `انا للہ و انا الیہ راجعون` (Indeed, we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return).
- [Reference needed]
Now after that Walid, who was the governor of Medina at that time, said that Hussain, I have received a message from Yazid that you should pledge allegiance to Yazid. Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, explained that this is an issue of allegiance. It is not decided in the darkness of the night like this. Tomorrow, during the day, summon the Muslims, everyone will come, and then it will be decided who is worthy of allegiance, to whom allegiance should be pledged, and who will pledge allegiance. Who will pledge allegiance? Walid insisted. When Walid insisted, Hussain, peace be upon him, said that Walid, if you insist, then listen to my answer: `«مثلی لا یبایع مثلہ»` (A person like me does not pledge allegiance to a person like him).
- [Reference needed]
And saying this, Imam Hussain, peace be upon him, started to leave. As soon as he started to leave, Marwan called out to Walid. Marwan, the accursed, called out and said, 'Walid, stop Hussain right now, take allegiance from him or strike off his neck, otherwise, if Hussain leaves today, then you will not be able to take allegiance from him until rivers of blood flow in Medina.' As soon as Marwan uttered these ominous words, Hussain, peace be upon him, turned back and shouted, the son of Fatimah, peace be upon them, was enraged: `«اتهددنی بالقتل یا ابن الزرقا»` (Do you threaten me with murder, O son of the blue-eyed woman)?
- [Reference needed]
O son of the base woman, do you threaten me with death? Do you frighten me with death? Who will kill me? You or Walid? As soon as Hussain's voice was raised, Hazrat Abbas, peace be upon them, came with the young men of Bani Hashim, with their hands on their swords. The Imam stopped them. Abbas, peace be upon them, asked, 'Master, who dared?' 'Master, who was disrespectful?' Abbas, peace be upon them, could not bear it that anyone would dare against Hussain, peace be upon him. He put his hand on his sword, Hussain, peace be upon him, stopped him, 'Brother Abbas, peace be upon him, be patient, this is the stage of patience.' I will say, Master, how long will you stop Abbas, peace be upon him? Karbala also came, Abbas, peace be upon him, remained patient.

#### Imam Hussain's (A.S.) Departure from Medina

Hussain, peace be upon him, returned and gave the news, he gave the news that, 'Sister Zainab, peace be upon them, Medina is no longer livable, we will have to leave Medina, and now you prepare for the journey.' And saying this, Hussain, peace be upon him, went to his grandfather, peace be upon him and his holy family's, grave. When he returned, the news had spread in Medina that Hussain, peace be upon him, was leaving Medina. Lady Umm Salama came and said, 'Son, I heard that you are leaving Medina, where are you going?' He said, 'I am going to Iraq.' As soon as she heard Iraq, Umm Salama's heart trembled. She said, 'Son, your grandfather, peace be upon him and his holy family, said something about Iraq.' He said, 'Yes, grandmother, grandfather, peace be upon him and his holy family, said it correctly, what grandfather, peace be upon him and his holy family, said will happen.' Umm Salama said, 'Son, then why are you going?' He said, 'I went to grandfather's, peace be upon him and his holy family, grave, grandfather, peace be upon him and his holy family, said, 'Go, son, sacrifice yourself, go sacrifice yourself for the survival of religion.'' So grandmother, I am going.

#### The Karbala Soil and Lady Umm Salama's Vision

And after that, miraculously, Hussain, peace be upon him, raised the land of Karbala and showed it to Lady Umm Salama. When Lady Umm Salama saw the land of Karbala, Hussain, peace be upon him, took a little soil of Karbala and gave it to Lady Umm Salama, saying, 'Grandmother, keep this soil of Karbala, as long as this soil is soil, your Hussain, peace be upon him, is alive.' 'When this soil turns into blood, understand that your Hussain, peace be upon him, has been martyred.' Umm Salama brought that soil and kept it near the soil that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, had given. She kept both soils, the one the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, had given was in a vial, and this soil was kept separately. Now whenever Umm Salama felt anxious, she would come and look at the soil, she would see it was soil. Then she would be reassured that Hussain, peace be upon him, was still alive. Until the time of Asr of Ashura, Umm Salama was resting, fire broke out in the vision, what did she see that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him and his holy family, came in a dream, his collar was torn, sleeves were rolled up, he was putting dust on his head. 'O Umm Salama, you are sleeping peacefully, my house has been plundered, my Hussain, peace be upon him, has been martyred.' Immediately Umm Salama woke up from the dream, came towards the soil, what did she see that now that soil was not soil but blood. Umm Salama slapped her face, recited lamentations, `وا حسینا وا حسینا` (O Hussain! O Hussain!). The women of Bani Hashim gathered, 'Lady, do not say this, our Hussain, peace be upon him, is on a journey.' Umm Salama said, 'Oh, Hussain, peace be upon him, is no longer alive, now Hussain's `وا حسینا` (O Hussain!)' The women of Bani Hashim mourned.
